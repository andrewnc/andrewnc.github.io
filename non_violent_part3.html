    <h1>Non-Violent Propaganda Through Continuous PDEs</h1>
    <p><em>By Andrew Carr - Jan 2025</em></p>
    <hr>

    <p>
        In our earlier writings, we devoted much attention to the mechanics of discrete networks and repeated signals:
        nodes in a graph, each receiving small “nudges” that accumulate into surprising, lasting shifts. While that
        theory captured the potency of subtle influences, it was anchored in a node-based worldview. Here, we embark on
        a new journey—one that treats public sentiment as a <strong>continuous field</strong> distributed through space
        (or any continuous manifold).
    </p>

    <p>
        This approach builds on a classical branch of mathematics: <em>partial differential equations</em> (PDEs).
        Instead of enumerating which neighbor influences which, or counting how many times a hashtag appears in your
        newsfeed, we imagine a “smooth fabric” of opinions. Much like the temperature in a room or the concentration of
        a chemical reacting in a fluid, the public mood spreads, interacts, and sometimes snaps into new states under
        gentle, non-violent forces. But how can such a fluid view of beliefs inform us about propaganda—and more
        importantly, about <em>non-violent</em> propaganda?
    </p>

    <p>
        As we’ll see, even a faint force, if patiently applied, can warp the “energy landscape” of public opinion. This
        new perspective does not negate our older operator-based theory. Rather, it reveals additional layers of
        elegance and complexity: equilibrium solutions, phase transitions, and <em>emergent</em> phenomena that can
        dominate the social imagination, all achieved without raising a single fist.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>1. Evolving a Field of Opinion</h2>

    <p>
        Imagine a three-dimensional region \( \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^3 \), whose points \( x \) might stand
        for different cities, different neighborhoods, or even abstract coordinates in a “demographic space” if we like.
        At each point \( x \), we define a scalar function \( u(x,t) \) that describes how “favorable” or “intense”
        a certain opinion is at time \( t \). We allow \( u \) to be negative or positive, or we might constrain it
        if the opinion naturally lies in a bounded interval.
    </p>

    <p>
        We then write a PDE that captures two things: first, how the opinion spreads or diffuses locally among
        neighbors; and second, how it responds to an external influence we call a <em>non-violent propaganda field</em>,
        \( f(x,t) \). A simple but revealing example is
    </p>

    <div class="center_me">
        \(
        \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}
        \;=\;
        \nabla \cdot\bigl( D(x)\,\nabla u \bigr)
        \;-\;
        \nabla V\bigl(u(x,t)\bigr)
        \; +\;
        f(x,t).
        \)
    </div>

    <p>
        Here, \( D(x) \) is a diffusion coefficient that may vary with \( x \), so that some regions are more
        “communicative” or more “open” to outside ideas. The term \( -\nabla V(u) \) encodes a potential function \(
        V \) that keeps the opinion near one or more “preferred” states. And \( f(x,t) \) is our external input—an
        informational push that we promise to keep gentle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Why gentle? Because the hallmark of <em>non-violent</em> propaganda is that we never inject extremely large or
        abrupt changes in \( u \). If we forced the system to jump abruptly, we’d be venturing into “coercion.” Thus,
        we can impose constraints on \( f \) (like bounding \( \| f \|_{L^1} \) or ensuring \( \nabla f \)
        remains small). In effect, we allow only a soft background murmur that, given enough time, can shift a
        population’s attitudes toward a new stable state.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>2. The Joy of Multiple Minima: Phase Transitions and Equilibria</h2>

    <p>
        One of the most delightful aspects of PDE-based opinion modeling is the possibility of <em>multiple stable
            equilibria.</em> We typically express these equilibria by looking for a steady-state solution \( u^*(x) \)
        that satisfies
    </p>

    <div class="center_me">
        \(
        0
        \;=\;
        \nabla \cdot\bigl( D(x) \nabla u^* \bigr)
        \;-\;
        \nabla V\bigl(u^*(x)\bigr)
        \; +\;
        f^*(x).
        \)
    </div>

    <p>
        Suppose \( V \) is a “double-well” potential, such as \( V(u) = \tfrac{1}{4}(u^2 - 1)^2 \), which has two
        minima (\( u=+1 \) and \( u=-1 \)). Without any forcing, different patches of the domain might settle into
        either the +1 or -1 opinion. But once we apply a small, patient bias \( f \), we can tilt the entire domain
        toward one stable solution. At first, it may shift only a little, but over time, regions that cling to the other
        state can get “persuaded” to flip if that side becomes less favorable in the overall energy balance.
    </p>

    <p>
        This phenomenon—where a small but persistent nudge eventually “tips” an entire domain—appears not only in social
        science but also in physics, chemistry, and pattern formation theory. We can see traveling domain walls or
        partial boundaries between different equilibria, and under a certain threshold of forcing, these domain walls
        can recede, giving way to the winning phase. In social terms, you can imagine some communities resisting a
        message but eventually succumbing if that message is ubiquitous and continuously reinforced. The magic is that
        at no point did we forcibly coerce them; we just never let up on the gentle pressure.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>3. A Variational View: Minimizing “Energy” Without Violence</h2>

    <p>
        In many PDE models, there is a deep connection between equilibrium solutions and the minimization of some
        “energy functional.” For instance, consider
    </p>

    <div class="center_me">
        \(
        \mathcal{E}[u]
        \;=\;
        \int_{\Omega}
        \Bigl(
        \tfrac12\,D(x)\,\|\nabla u(x)\|^2
        \; +\;
        V\bigl(u(x)\bigr)
        \Bigr)
        \,\mathrm{d}x
        \; -\;
        \int_{\Omega}
        u(x)\,g(x)
        \,\mathrm{d}x,
        \)
    </div>

    <p>
        where \( g(x) \) is a function that represents how the external force accumulates (e.g., \( g = \int f \)).
        If \( g \) is small and smooth, we interpret this as a gentle, distributed persuasion. As the PDE evolves
        (often in a gradient-flow manner), the system tries to reduce \( \mathcal{E}[u] \), searching for a local
        minimum. Because \( V \) might have several minima, there can be multiple local “valleys” in \( \mathcal{E}
        \), and the particular equilibrium reached might depend on how persistent and uniform \( f \) is.
    </p>

    <p>
        This “energy minimization” viewpoint fits neatly with a notion of non-violence, in that we do not drive the
        system with high-amplitude impulses or discontinuities. Instead, we gently reshape the energy landscape, letting
        the system gracefully descend into a new attractor over time. This is reminiscent of slow social movements,
        where daily exposure to a certain theme or idea eventually cements it as the new norm—an “energy minimum” in the
        minds of the populace.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>4. Capturing the Magic: A Simple Code Demo in \(\mathbb{R}^3\)</h2>

    <p>
        Let us bring our theoretical musings into the tangible realm. While equations and variational principles
        illuminate the path, there's a certain magic in watching these opinion fields evolve before our eyes. We've
        implemented a modest yet revealing simulation in Python that captures the essence of our non-violent propaganda
        theory in three spatial dimensions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Picture a cubic volume of space, divided into a 30×30×30 mesh of points. At each point lives a number between -1
        and +1, representing the local strength of an opinion. We begin in a state of predominantly negative sentiment
        (near -1), with tiny random fluctuations that mirror the natural variety of human thought. This is our canvas,
        upon which we'll paint with the gentlest of brushes.
    </p>

    <p>
        Our "brush" takes the form of a soft Gaussian force, strongest at the domain's center and fading gracefully
        toward the edges. At its peak, this persuasive field exerts a mere 0.05 units of influence - a whisper, not a
        shout. Like a skilled orator who knows that the softest voice sometimes commands the most attention, our force
        field patiently nudges the system toward positive opinion.
    </p>

    <p>
        The accompanying figure reveals the rich dynamics at play:
    </p>

    <img src="propaganda_output.png" alt="Opinion Field Evolution"
        style="display: block; margin: 2em auto; max-width: 100%; height: auto;">

    <p>
        In the top row, we glimpse the initial state: a sea of blue representing widespread negative sentiment,
        punctuated by slight variations. Alongside it, we see our gentle forcing function - a warm, diffuse glow that
        peaks softly in the center of the domain. This is our non-violent influence, spreading like a morning mist
        rather than crashing like a wave.
    </p>

    <p>
        The middle row offers different perspectives on our persuasive field. Through various slices and projections, we
        can appreciate its smooth, continuous nature. There are no sharp edges, no sudden jumps - only gradual
        transitions that respect the natural flow of information through social space.
    </p>

    <p>
        But it's the bottom row that tells the most compelling story. After 300 time steps of patient evolution, we
        observe a dramatic shift in the opinion landscape. The once-dominant negative sentiment has largely given way to
        positive values, yet this transformation occurred without any point in space experiencing a force greater than
        our whisper-quiet 0.05 threshold. This is the essence of non-violent propaganda: not the absence of change, but
        the achievement of change through persistently gentle means.
    </p>

    <p>
        The statistics tell a similar tale. Our forcing field averages a mere 0.021 units across the domain - less than
        half its peak value. Yet it transforms a landscape that began with a mean opinion of -0.950 into one centered at
        0.847. The transition is comprehensive but never coercive; the minimum and maximum values in our final state
        (0.762 and 0.931) show that the entire domain has shifted while maintaining its internal variation.
    </p>

    <p>
        What makes this implementation particularly illuminating is its handling of diffusion. Opinions don't just
        respond to our gentle forcing; they communicate with their neighbors through a diffusive term that models the
        natural spread of ideas through social contact. This interplay between local diffusion and global forcing
        creates fascinating patterns of opinion change - sometimes gradual, sometimes exhibiting sharp transitions, but
        always evolving within the bounds of our non-violent constraints.

    <p>
        The simulation, though modest in its numerical sophistication, captures the core dynamics we've been exploring
        theoretically. It demonstrates how a patient, distributed influence can reshape an entire opinion landscape
        without ever resorting to sharp forcings or sudden changes. Like a skilled gardener who knows that plants cannot
        be forced to grow but can be gently guided with the right conditions, our PDE system shows how subtle
        influences, properly applied, can nurture dramatic yet natural transformations in the field of public opinion.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through this computational window, we catch a glimpse of how non-violent propaganda might operate in real social
        spaces: not through sharp commands or jarring disruptions, but through the patient cultivation of new
        equilibria,
        one infinitesimal step at a time. The mathematics, made visible through our simulation, reveals the profound
        power of gentleness when applied with persistence and precision.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>5. Looking Ahead: Adaptive Forcing, Noise, and Ethical Implications</h2>

    <p>
        While our toy example illustrates the raw mechanics, real societies are rarely as clean as a uniform mesh with a
        well-defined double-well potential. In practice, individuals differ in susceptibility, communities may cluster
        or segregate, and “random noise” inevitably seeps in. One natural extension is to add a random term \(
        \sigma\eta(x,t) \) to the PDE, representing the swirl of unpredictable events in daily life. In that case,
        the system might wander among stable states unless the gentle propaganda is sufficiently persistent to hold it
        in one stable configuration.
    </p>

    <p>
        We can also imagine <em>adaptive forcing</em>: if a region is especially resistant, the propagandist might
        slightly increase \( f \) there while remaining under a “non-violence” cap. Alternatively, the forcing might
        dial down once the domain has mostly flipped, conserving resources while preventing a backlash. Each twist leads
        to intriguing PDE control problems: how to guide a complex, continuous field to a desired final shape using
        low-amplitude inputs.
    </p>

    <p>
        None of this is purely theoretical. The PDE perspective unifies a wide range of phenomena in physics, chemistry,
        biology, and social science under the same mathematical umbrella of multi-stable systems with small external
        forcing. From an ethical viewpoint, it underscores that <em>non-violent</em> does not mean weak or
        insignificant; it simply means controlling the total amplitude and <em>rate</em> of persuasion, allowing the
        system to evolve instead of forcing it violently. That subtle difference, ironically, can make the influence
        even more insidious at times, because it is less obvious—there is no single moment of crisis, just a quiet,
        constant drift.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Conclusion: A Continuous Vision of Non-Violent Influence</h2>

    <p>
        Stepping back, we see that even without discrete “channels” of repeated signals, we can describe non-violent
        propaganda as a continuous, spatially-distributed push embedded in PDEs. By gently shaping the potential
        landscape and letting diffusion do the rest, entire populations can shift from one collective mindset to
        another. In the presence of multiple stable equilibria, this shift can be abrupt or gradual, but it is never
        forced by raw coercion—only by the patient rewriting of energetic incentives.
    </p>

        There is a certain magic in this paradigm. It echoes the same fundamental lessons of our earlier operator-based
        approach: <em>tiny influences, if sustained and widespread, can reshape entire communities</em>. What the PDE
        picture adds is the graceful fluidity of these transitions, the possibility of domain walls and traveling
        interfaces, and the direct applicability of deep variational principles. Moving forward, one might explore
        random fluctuations, inhomogeneous boundary conditions, or even PDEs on curved manifolds that represent complex
        social topologies.

        In short, the tapestry of PDE theory offers a fresh and illuminating lens on how non-violent propaganda might
        operate. It is subtle, pervasive, and ultimately powerful—quietly coaxing a distributed public to accept new
        equilibria, one differential step at a time.
