		<h2>Projects</h2>
	</div>



	<div>
		<h3>Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
		<p> I love using code to solve problems, here are a few examples of projects I have done that either solved a problem, or could be used as a tool in problem solving.</p>
		<div class="project">
			<p>This is small project I wrote of a BST implemenation with an additional class for AVL trees.</p>
			<a href="trees.txt" target="_blank">Trees.py</a>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p>I used Breadth First Search and graph theory to find an actor's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers" target="_blank">Bacon Number</a>. There is a required data set that is available <a href="movieData.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<a href="bfs_kbacon.txt" target="_blank">BFS.py</a>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p>I have also worked with <a href="markov_chains.txt" target="_blank">Markov Chains</a> to create a Taylor Swift <a href="tswift1989.txt" target="_blank" title="required data set">lyrics</a> generator, Fourier Anlysis to edit sounds making it seem like a piano at home is being played in a concert hall, and eigenfaces to build a <a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/facial-recognition" target="_blank">Facial Recognition</a> system.</p>
		</div>





		<h3>Extra Curricular</h3>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://andrewnc.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">Hackathon</a>
			<p>This project is our 1st place entry at the annual BYU ACM Hackathon. We used polynomial interpolation to graph user input and return the math equation for the words you entered. Follow the link above to try it out for yourself. It is written in Python and uses the Django framework to render the data.</p>
		</div>
		
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4TqEMi3hSiVTVF2bllaVTFCeE0" target="_blank">Voter Turnout</a>
			<p>I am interested in numbers, and how they can tell a story. This project is my first dip into the world of statistics and data analysis. I worked on this projected back in late 2015 with very little formal training. It is pretty elementary, but definitely highlights my curiousity.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/PONG" target="_blank">Pong</a>
			<p>When asked if I knew anything about Aritificial intellegence, I wanted to be able to say yes! One of the best ways to learn is by doing, and trying. So I wrote a game of pong - and made some bots that you could test your skills against. There are 3 levels of bots and each of them use different calculations to try and hit the ball: <ol><li>Derp AI</li><li>Smart AI</li><li>Impossible to beat AI</li></ol> It takes some configuration to get it up and running, since I didn't build it to distribute, but it is was a very fun project.</p>

		<h3>Research</h3>
		<div class="project">
			<p><b>BYU CS Department</b><br />
			I am currently working on a machine learning project with a member of the Computer Science department, we are researching low cost MRI
			configurations and applying generative machine learning to improve relatively poor quality imaging, thus allowing for wide spread medical imaging.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p><b>BYU Math Department</b><br />
			We worked to discovered proper boundary condition equations to more accurately model pressure waves using numerical methods, resulting in a method of approximation that was 3x faster than previous methods. This project was very mathematically rigorous, and required a great deal of effort. I was very successful, and presented our findings at the spring research conference. </p>

		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p><b>Carnegie Mellon University - IT Lab Fellowship</b><br /> I excelled in Data Science course work earning top marks. I worked with techBridgeWorld and Analyzed data and developed custom web games to assist refugees learn English. I also presented secondary research to peers and mentors.</p>

		<h3>Entrepreneurial</h3>
		<p>I have been a member of several tech start ups. While none of them got off the ground, I learned extremely valuable lessons and gained some great skills and perspective that have served me well, and will continue to do so.</p>
		<div class="project">
			<p><b>Wishtory</b> <br /> I am currently making a wish list app that helps parents teach their kids the importance of patience and how to save for things. It is aimed to reduce stress of parents, and increase children's knowledge about delayed gratification.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p><b>Vizr</b> <br/> This was a marketing start up aimed to end the need for expensive marketing consultants. It was aimed to use google trends and other expert information to help small businesses know how to market effectively.</p><p>On this project, I was the User Experience lead. I worked to make mock-ups and design the user interactions for our product</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p><b>Tagz</b> <br/>This was a personal start up where I was making an online note taking app without all of the extra "fluff". It had a unique "tagging" system that allowed for easy retrieval and organization of information.</p>
		</div>

		<h3> Writing and Communication </h3>
		<div class="project">
			<p>Technical skills aren't the only important skills. There isn't much point in solving a problem, if you don't have the ability to convince someone you've solved their problem through written and verbal communication. Here are just a few samples of my writing.</p>
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4TqEMi3hSiVS1ZKeHBrcnJUeWc" target="_blank">Stats Final Project</a><br/>
			<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4TqEMi3hSiVS3RrN0dfVVZyb0k" target="_blank">Essay Contest Entry</a><br/>
			<p>I also love public speaking. I have given numerious speeches, lessons, informational sessions, and presentations.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<div style="margin-bottom:100px;">
		<h3>Social Good</h3>
		<p>I am very passionate about helping others and doing work that has social impact. Here are two examples of volunteer work I have done.</p>
		<div class="project">
			<p>I led a team of ~20 people that worked 500+ man hours to collect and send over 1,000 lbs of school supplies, hygiene kits, and clothes to orphans in Syria. This project was one of the first socially impactful things I worked on. It was very rewarding and taught me a lot about working with others, and gave me great leadership experience.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p>I worked for 2 years as a volunteer missionary in the Phillipines. I primarily spent my time teaching life skills, building basic infrastructure, serving the people through song and council, and leading other groups of missionaries in their efforts. During this time I developed a love for the Filipino people, their language and culture. </p>
