                <p><h4>The perfect position that never happened</h4></p>

<p>"you were the first person to solve this entire problem"</p>

<p>"If you decide to come, look me up, I have some questions about your research"</p>

<p>These were phrases from my interviewers after I passed the technical bar for Google Research. I had applied for years, and been rejected equally often. This time, however, I was well prepared and got glowing feedback.</p>

<p>Then came the dreaded project matching phase. I could still end up without a spot, even given the nice words and my performance (foreshadowing).</p> 

<p>My recruiter asked if I had reached out to any teams yet. I had. When I mentioned which teams I was talking with, she brought up a small problem.</p> 

<p>"That team sits in Paris, your application was only for North America." Oops. I applied again, interviewed again, and again passed the technical bar.</p> 

<p>I was ecstatic. I reached out to the team in Paris and we met at NeurIPS 2019. I had an accepted paper in their workshop on optimal transport theory. They seemed impressed with my skills and said they would talk with other people at the conference then submit a project internally.</p> 

<p>This morning, almost 5 months after beginning the process, I found out that the single spot on their team has been filled and I wouldn’t be going after all.</p> 

<p>I’m disappointed. Mostly at the situation.</p> 

<p>My PhD studies are not going as planned. I am stuck and this was a clear way to add gas to my small flame of research talent. I’m not sure what comes next, but I do know something will work out.</p> 

<p><h4>My ideal role</h4></p>

<p>Throughout this afternoon and evening, I have had time to reflect on what I truly want to do for work. The generic answers have circled time and again in my mind.</p> 

<p>"I want to have an impact"</p>

<p>"I want to leave my mark"</p>

<p>These answers really aren’t helpful. And so my introspective journey continued, round and round. I want to work in ML, using my applied math skills I’ve so carefully honed.</p> 

<p>I want to have leadership and responsibility. I want ownership and to create value in an organization. But am I punching above my weight class? I don’t have the deep systemic expertize most groups are looking for in a leader.</p> 

<p>The natural question that follows is “how can I gain that skill, while not going crazy from lack of ownership?”</p>

<p>I’m not sure. There may not even be an optimal answer.</p> 

<p>I do know I want to keep abreast on modern research, implement prototypes, present my work to decision makers, and guide strategic processes. I know I have a lot to learn, but I also have a large skill set that can be used to generate value. </p>

<p><h4>Next Steps</h4></p>

<p>The truth is, I don’t know what comes next for me. I don’t think finishing my PhD at my current institution is the answer. My needs and goals are taking a back seat in this program.</p> 

<p>I guess I’ll officially be a college drop out :)</p>
