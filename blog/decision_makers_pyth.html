                        <blockquote>"The fool tells me his reasons; the wise man persuades me with my own."</blockquote>
                        <p>-Aristotle</p>
                        <p>In any organization, data scientists will interact with decision makers. We can't live in a bubble of <a href="/blog/monte_pi_hy.html">Monte Carlo integration</a> or <a href="/blog/logistic_regression_yorick.html">Logistic Regression</a>. As much as we may want to run our models all day, without the key abilities of communication, persuasion, and listening data science can become a huge <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/beoxx8/discussion_when_ml_and_data_science_are_the_death/">black hole of money</a>.</p>
                        <p>Now, in truth, persuasive public speaking isn't easy. I've given a number of talks, presentations, demos and every time I encounter different challenges.</p>
                        <p>I was once meeting with some decision makers about building an internal semantic code search tool with code2vec and a complex natural language interface. I had prepared all of my justifications and reasons about how much programmer time we could save. I was ready for every question. Except the obvious question.</p>
                        <blockquote>What is the benefit over <code>ctrl-f</code>?</blockquote>
                        - Decision maker
                        <p>I ended up building a small demo, and we (luckily) scrapped the project. I learned some valuable lessons through that process.</p>
                        <p>One of those lessons I am sharing today in this post.</p>
                        <h4>Brevity<sup style="font-size: medium;"><a href="#footnote1" style="color:blue;">1</a></sup></h4>
                        <p>Decision makers are busy people; the weight of organizational success rides on their shoulders. They don't have time for 45 pages of carefully formatted $\LaTeX$. They need answers, and they need them yesterday! At least, that's what the movies tell me.</p>
                        <p>Either way, if there is one way to be brief, it is to write shorter code. That's where Pyth comes into play.</p>
                        <img src="blog_files/pyth_logo.png" title="There is no official logo, so I slaved over this one" />
                        <p><a href="https://pyth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pyth</a> is a code golfing language developed for brevity. You program will take up far fewer bytes written in Pyth than in many other languages.</p>
                        <p>In a boring language, like Python, you may write something like the following:</p>
                        <pre>for i in range(10):
    print(i)</pre>
                        <p>You would then be rewarded with 0 through 9 printed to your screen. However, this incredible verbose program takes just 3 characters in Pyth</p>
                        <pre>VTN</pre>
                        <pre>pyth -c 'VTN'
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7
8
9</pre>


                        <p>How's that for brevity?</p>
                        <p>The less code you write, the less code you need to explain and maintain.</p>
                        <h4>Pyth Basics</h4>
                        <p>Pyth is a fully procedural language, but is often written functionally or imperatively. It is quite expressive, and has a huge number of key characters that can be used. You can try it out online <a href="http://pyth.herokuapp.com/">here</a>.</p>
                        <p>Pyth uses prefix notation, so if you want to ask where the occurrences of a character are in a list, you would specify the list using the list operator <code>[</code> and then use the find operator <code>x</code>.</p>
                        <pre>>>> [3 2 5 6 3 2 1 4 5 6)
[3, 2, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5, 6]
>>> x5Q
[2, 8]</pre>
                        <p><code>Q</code> takes and evaluates previous input lines, so it holds the value of our list.</p>
                        <p>You can do a lot of useful things quickly in Pyth due to the design of the various operators. Say, for example, you are a student of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipism">Flipism</a> and you have a list of decisions and you want to choose one.</p>
                        <pre>>>> ["gym" "sleep" "game" "eat"
['gym', 'sleep', 'game', 'eat']
>>> O
sleep</pre>
                        <p>By using the <code>O</code>, random choice, operator (with an implicit <code>Q</code>) we choose to sleep.</p>
                        <h4>Product Reviews</h4>
                        <p>Ok, let's imagine you work for MacroHard and they've made a new gaming console. This gaming console, Xbox 2$\pi$, is set to be a hit. Over the first few months of beta testing, you have received a number of user reviews<sup><a href="http://kavita-ganesan.com/micropinion-generation/">2</a></sup>. You want to now, briefly, convince the decision makers about the trends of this product. Do people like it? What are some issues?</p>
                        <p>We start by reading in the file and saving it to a variable.</p>
                        <pre>>>> J'"filename.data"J
>>> lJ
1211</pre>
                        <p>We now have a length $1211$ list, split by new lines from the file, which we can analyze.</p>
                        <p>We'll do a simple analysis where we search all of the reviews for key words, we start by joining all of the values together into a single string and taking the length.</p>
                        <pre>>>> KjdJ
>>> lK
107410
>>> lcK
21863
</pre>
                        <p>We have $107,410$ characters and $21,863$ words (found by using <code>c</code> to split by white space)</p>
                        <p>We then can do a quick regex search <code>:</code> for various key words.</p>
                        <pre>>>> l:K"good"1
45
>>> l:K"bad"1
9
>>> l:K"love"1
20
>>> l:K"hate"1
6
>>> l:K"fast"1
10
>>> l:K"slow"1
3</pre>
                        <p>With our knowledge in hand, we can return to our decision making colleagues and say that, while things aren't perfect, people seem to be enjoying the circular gaming console.</p>
