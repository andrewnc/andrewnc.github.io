                <blockquote> (takes the skull) Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio, a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his back a thousand times, and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is! My gorge rises at it.</blockquote>

                <p>Welcome back! In this post we'll be exploring another array based language. However, unlike <a href="/blog/first_plot_j.html">J</a> this language is not packed into as few characters as possible.</p>
                <p>Yorick was created by physicist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_H._Munro">David Munro</a> in 1996 at Lawrence Livermore national lab. It was designed for numerical computation and mathematical simulation. It was fairly easy to install and has a nice C-like syntax.</p>
                <p>You simply fire up the repl and can start coding</p>

> 
                </pre>
                <pre>> print, "Hello, World!"<br />Hello, World!</pre>
                <p>My first order of business was to see if I can plot something. I ran <code>> plg, random(2)</code>. The docs suggested that a graphics window should open and display the desired plot.</p>
                <p>I spent a few hours trying to get this to work with little success. I opened an issue on Github and decided to cheat a little. I wrote my own simple plotting utility.</p>
                <pre>func plot(a, b){
    file = text_csv("data_file.csv", a, b);
    close,file
    // system, "scatter --f data_file.csv";
    system, "python3 plot.py data_file.csv";
}
</pre>
                <p>Yes, yes, I know. I wrote a python file that reads a csv (written to via Yorick's <code>text_csv</code> function) and plots the contents. I have no illusions of scalability, I just wanted something a bit quick.</p>
                <p>It's really unfortunate I couldn't get plotting to work natively, there is a large body of work online that suggests Yorick's plotting is top notch. If any of my readers have a solution, it would be greatly appreciated.</p>
                <p>However, other than this small hiccup, coding in Yorick was a joy.</p>
                <h4>Logistic Regression</h4>
                <p>Imagine you are a young data scientist, cleaning data like a digital detergent, fitting regression lines left and right when you come across a problem. What is the likelihood that a physical therapy patient has back pain given a number of measurements?</p>
                <p>Not to fear, you are armed with regression!</p>
                <p>$$y = Wx + b$$</p>
                <p>You solve for $W$ via gradient descent, or use an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares">exact solution</a>... but then you look back at the problem statement and see that you need "likelihood".</p>
                <p>Well, you likely remember that likelihood is a synonym for probability. How do we get probabilities? That's where the logistic part of logistic regression comes in to play.</p>
                <p>The logistic function $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0,1]$ $$\frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$ can be used to interpret real values as probabilities.</p>
                <p>In our case, we take the beautiful equation from above $y = Wx+b$ and wrap it in a logistic function to obtain probabilities. $$\frac{1}{1 + e^{-(Wx + b)}}$$</p>
                <p>Boom, so by using that equation we can get the likelihood of someone having back pain (yes or no) given a number of measurements.</p>
                <h4>The code!</h4>
                <p>We'll start by including our hand made plotting function, and a linear regression utility</p>
                <pre>#include "plot.i"
#include "regress.i"
</pre>
                <p>We then need to read in our data, Yorick makes this process extremely simple.</p>
                <pre>df = text_cells("back_pain_data.csv", ",")(1:-1,);</pre>
                <p>Here we are slicing off the last column which is not useful for our purposes. Something important to note, and disappointing for me is that Yorick is 1-indexed.</p>
                <pre>> a = random(10)

> print, a
[0.0891647,0.0719207,0.739632,0.191635,0.350893,0.597056,0.420973,0.608159,
0.607138,0.0986435]
> a(0)
0.0986435
> a(1)
0.0891647
> a(-1)
0.607138
</pre>
                <p>Many high powered scientific languages are 1-indexed, so the choice makes sense.</p>
                <p>I then decided that the built in <code>numberof</code> function was insufficient. It returned a full count (similar to <code>#</code> in J) of all the items in this list.</p>
                <p>So I wrote a small utility <code>shape</code> function for working with 2-d arrays. Again, it doesn't scale very well, but it worked for my purposes.</p>
                <pre>func shape(df){
    if(numberof(df) > 0){
        return [numberof(df(1,)), numberof(df(,1))];
    }
}</pre>
                <p>This allowed me to see row and column information of the newly created dataframe</p>
                <pre>> shape(df)
[310,13]</pre>
                <p>Excellent! I spent several hours trying to figure out how to cast strings to integers. I felt so silly, I scoured the documentation (or so I thought) and couldn't find anything.</p>
                <p>I brought this up to some colleagues, and within 3 minutes they had found the <code>tonum</code> function... That's what I get for coding instead of sleeping, lesson learning.</p>
                <p>We can now cast various columns of <code>df</code> no numeric types with no trouble. I started by converting the proper labels to a binary representation.</p>
                <pre>/* convert the labels to binary digits*/
df(0,)(where(df(0,) == "Normal")) = "0"
df(0,)(where(df(0,) == "Abnormal")) = "1"
df = tonum(df)</pre>
                <p>This takes the last column and sets the values according to a where criterion. The <code>where( == )</code> function returns a mask that we can use to index into our list.</p>
                <p>I wrote another small utility function, <code>head</code>, that allows me to peak at the array.</p>
                <pre>func head(df){
    print, df(, 1:6)
}</pre>
                <pre>> head, df

                <p>For the curious, the column values are</p>
                <pre>["pelvic_incidence","pelvic tilt","lumbar_lordosis_angle","sacral_slope","pelvic_radius","degree_spondylolisthesis","pelvic_slope","Direct_tilt","thoracic_slope","cervical_tilt","sacrum_angle","scoliosis_slope","Status"]</pre>
                <p>I'm not going to focus on what each column represents in this post, but in general they are physical measurements relating to the back and body.</p>
                <p>We're in the home stretch now. We just need to split our independent and dependent variables.</p>
                <pre>y = df(0,)
x = df(1:-1,)</pre>
                <p>I tried for quite some time to shuffle the data, I even wrote a shuffle function that I was pretty proud of:</p>
                <pre>func randint(low, high, n){
    return floor(low + (high - low) * random(n))
}

func shuffle(li_in){
    li = li_in
    for(i=1;i < numberof(li);i++){
        r = sread(totxt(i + (randint(0,numberof(li)+3,1)(1) % (numberof(li) - i))), "i")
        tmp=li(i) 
        li(i)=li(r) 
        li(r)=tmp 
    }
    return li
}</pre>
                <p>However, the <code>sread</code> function was being a bit finicky, and would only spit out "doubles" and I needed a "long" to index into the array properly. So I decided not to pursue that further.</p>
                <p>So in this analysis, performance will purely be measured on the training set, which is generally bad practice, so we won't really be able to measure generalization of our model.</p>
                <p>However! In spite of the small set back, we can now find our $W$ values using the build in OLS regression function.</p>
                <pre>w = regress(y, grow(transpose(x), 1))</pre>
                <p>We include a column of 1s on the end to account for the bias term.</p>
                <p>We can then run inference by using these weights.</p>
                <pre>func infer(x_i, w){
    x_i = grow(transpose(x_i), 1)
    y_hat = x_i(,+) * w(+)
    return (1 / (1 + exp(-y_hat)))
}</pre>
                <p>These three lines add a column of 1s to the data we want to infer. Then we do an element wise dot product. Yorick allows us to specify which dimension operations occur on with a <code>(+)</code> symbol and commas. </p>
                <p>We then return the logistic value for the data, which will likely be an array if you are working with more than a single data point. </p>
                <p>The output of this function is a collection of probabilities which can be used as you see fit. I decided to threshold them for classification, just to showcase.</p>
                <pre>y_hat(where(y_hat > .61)) = 1
y_hat(where(y_hat < .61)) = 0</pre>
                <p>Then, if we run this on our training data, we see</p>

                <h4>Wrapping up</h4>
                <p>In conclusion, I enjoyed Yorick somewhat. I felt its type system was far too Dynamic for my taste. I often found myself confused at the type of object returned or expected by various functions. However, there are a number of really great utilities for working with numerical data in a scientific computing setting. It's definitely a language I'll try again sometime.</p>
