			<p>Our team again won 1st place at the annual BYU ACM Hackathon. We built a system that used screen shots of the browser, taken at 60 FPS to play the legendary <a href="https://chromedino.com/" target="_blank">chrome dino</a> game perfectly. We used a combination of image recognition, and deterministic decision rules to solve the game which allowed our agent to play perfectly.</p>

			<p>Our project won 1st place at the annual BYU ACM Hackathon. We used polynomial interpolation to graph user input and return the math equation for the words you entered. Follow the link above to try it out for yourself. It is written in Python and uses the Django framework to render the data.</p>

This projected involed web scraping, data cleaning, feature engineering, and basic data analysis along with several insightful visualizations. I believe it highlights my abilities as a data scientist.

			<a href="https://youtu.be/3egQki5ydTk" target="_blank">Control Theory</a>
			<p>Use LQR while solving the algebraic ricotta equation to balance a pendulum at an arbitrary starting position. This is an example of optimal control. What is most interesting is that this problem could be solved much easier with modern RL techniques. But it is still possible and interesting to do with traditional control theory.

			<p>My primary field of interest is Machine Learning. I love using the computer to find patterns and insights in data. This <a href="https://www.github.com/andrewnc/MachineLearning" target="_blank">link</a> takes you to my github page where I have played around with several methods on some datasets. This experience is mostly a comparison of common machine learning methods with insight into which ones work well on different types of data.</p>

			<p>In depth analysis using machine learning and clustering methods of player skill level in the popular League of Legends game. In this project I use machine learning techniques to answer the question "as player skill increases, are we better able to determine win percentage using in game actions." The answer is NO. We actually get worse at predicting skill. This is a fascinating discovery discussed in the paper.</p>

		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://thompsonsampling.pythonanywhere.com" target="_blank">Thompson Sampling</a>
			<p>Traditional wisdom says that A/B testing is the best (sometimes the only) way to optimize web pages. However, Thompson Sampling uses probability to ensure that you get faster results (learn which page is better more quickly) and lose less revenue during the testing process. I made a small example that uses Thompson Sampling to optimize between two simple pages. click <a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/thompsonsampling" target="_blank">here</a> to see the code behind the scenes.</p>

			<a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B4TqEMi3hSiVTVF2bllaVTFCeE0" target="_blank">Voter Turnout</a>
			<p>I am interested in numbers, and how they can tell a story. This project is my first dip into the world of statistics and data analysis. I worked on this project back in late 2015 with very little formal training. It is rather elementary, but definitely highlights my curiousity.</p>
		</div> -->
		<div class="project">
			<a href="lyrics/index.html" target="_blank">Natural Language Processing Visualization</a>
			<p>This is primarily a data visualization project. I used NLTK to perform a sentiment analysis of the top 100 billboard songs of the past 50 years to see if music is getting more negative or positive. It was interesting to reflect on the results. Follow the link above to see my full analysis.</p>

			<a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/PONG" target="_blank">Pong</a>
			<p>When asked if I knew anything about Aritificial Intellegence, I wanted to be able to say yes! One of the best ways to learn is by doing, and trying. So I wrote a game of pong - and made some bots that you could test your skills against. There are 3 levels of bots and each of them use different calculations to try and hit the ball: <ol><li>Derp AI</li><li>Smart AI</li><li>Impossible to beat AI</li></ol> It takes some configuration to get it up and running, since I didn't build it to distribute, but it was a very fun project. I'm currently buildling a working demonstration.</p>

		<div class="project">
			<a href="datavis.html" target="_blank">Data Visualization</a>
			<p>This is a D3.js project where I collected, cleaned, and visualized letter relations in the english language from the constitution. The width of the connections between letters (and the number of letters they're connected to) is a representation of the strength of the connection.</p>

		<h3 class="algo">Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
		<p>I enjoy using code to solve problems, here are a few examples of projects I have done that either solved a problem, or could be used as a tool in problem solving.</p>
		<div class="project">
			<a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/andrewnc.github.io/blob/master/weightgain.ipynb" target="_blank">Mathematical Diet</a>
			<p>I love working with math also, so I decided to combine math and fitness to make a weight gain plan for myself. I have always struggled a bit when it comes to weight, and so I modeled my body type, activity level, etc and made a caloric intake eating plan for myself.</p>
			<p> I then exported the data to a csv, and pulled it in to by Google Calendar to have 'weigh ins' every 10 days to track my progress.</p>

			<p>Code for the modeling portion can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/andrewnc.github.io/blob/master/weightgain.ipynb" target="_blank">on my github</a></p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			  <p>Here we have a project where I worked with images to build a facial recognition system. It is fairly accurate, but the method is quite simple, and doesn't always generalize well. It was a great learning experience. This project uses eigenfaces and comparitive analysis in a <a href="https://github.com/andrewnc/facial-recognition" target="_blank">Facial Recognition</a> system.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p>This is small project I wrote of a BST implemenation with an additional class for AVL trees.</p>
			<a href="trees.txt" target="_blank">Trees.py</a>
		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p>This is a use of Breadth First Search and graph theory to find an actor's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Degrees_of_Kevin_Bacon#Bacon_numbers" target="_blank">Bacon Number</a>. There is a required data set that is available <a href="movieData.txt" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
			<a href="bfs_kbacon.txt" target="_blank">BFS.py</a>
			<p>Here is an example of the output after the Breadth First Search was used to find the shortest path from Samuel L. Jackson to Kevin Bacon</p>
			 <code>['Jackson, Samuel L.', 'Captain America: The First Avenger', 'Stark, Peter', 'X-Men: First Class', 'Bacon, Kevin']</code><p>which gives him a bacon number of 2.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="project">
			<p>Here we have an implementation of <a href="markov_chains.txt" target="_blank">Markov Chains</a> to create a Taylor Swift <a href="tswift1989.txt" target="_blank" title="required data set">lyrics</a> generator. Since Markov Chains only rely on the previous state, the generated English lyrics are non-sensical and somewhat amusing.

			configurations and applying generative machine learning to improve relatively poor quality imaging, thus allowing for widespread medical imaging.</p>
			<p>I also designed and constructed a CNN with custom loss function to removed background noise (e.g., restaurant) from conversational audio. This has application in audio assistance technologies such as hearing aids.</p>

			<p><b>BYU Math Department</b><br />
			We worked to discover proper boundary condition equations to more accurately model pressure waves using numerical methods, resulting in a method of approximation that was 3x faster than previous methods.

		<p>I am very passionate about helping others and doing work that has social impact. Here are two examples of volunteer work I have done.</p>
		<div class="project">
			<p>I led a team of ~20 people that worked 300+ man hours to collect and send over 1,000 lbs of school supplies, hygiene kits, and clothes to orphans in Syria.

		<div class="project">
			<p>I worked for 2 years as a volunteer missionary in the Phillipines.
