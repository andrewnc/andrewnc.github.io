  <h1>Non-Violent Propaganda Theory, Part 2: Leaders, In-Groups, and Surprising Equilibria</h1>

  <p><em>By Andrew Carr - Jan 2025</em></p>
  <hr />

  <p>
    In our previous exploration, we introduced a novel mathematical framework for <strong>non-violent
      propaganda</strong>, focusing on the idea that <em>repeated signals</em>—rather than overt force—can produce large
    shifts in public opinion or emotional states over time. We also introduced operators such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Non-Violence Index (NVI)</strong>: measuring reliance on force.</li>
    <li><strong>Emotional Sensitivity Operator</strong> (\( \Psi \)): modeling how repeated signals accumulate within
      individuals.</li>
    <li><strong>Propaganda Operator</strong> (\( \mathcal{P} \)): describing how each node’s state updates by combining
      social diffusion and cumulative signal effects.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Now, we push the theory further by incorporating two key ideas:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Leaders</strong>: Individuals or entities with disproportionate influence in shaping the network’s
      opinions.</li>
    <li><strong>In-Groups</strong>: Subsets of the population that form “echo chambers,” where internal connections are
      stronger (or more trusted) than external ones.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    We will see how these additions yield <em>surprising equilibrium structures</em>—for instance, sudden flips in
    collective sentiment, multiple stable emotional “basins,” or “hidden” attractors that only emerge when in-group
    leaders deploy persistent signals. Let’s explore.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Leaders as “Signal Amplifiers”</h2>

  <p>
    Even purely non-violent methods often rely on <strong>central voices or leaders</strong> to shape the discourse. In
    social science, these are sometimes called “opinion makers” or “influencers.” Mathematically, we can model leaders
    as <em>nodes whose influence weight is higher than average</em> and who have direct control over the repeated
    signals.
  </p>

  <h3>1.1 Introducing a Leader-Weighted Matrix</h3>

  <p>
    Recall from the previous post that we represent social diffusion using a matrix \(A\), whose entries \(A_{ij}\)
    describe how much person \(j\) influences person \(i\). Suppose we have a small set of leader nodes, \(L = \{\ell_1,
    \ell_2, \ldots\}\). We give these nodes a greater “broadcast power” by defining:
  </p>

  <div class="center_me">
    \(
    A^{(\mathrm{lead})}_{ij}
    \;=\;
    \begin{cases}
    \alpha \,A_{ij}, & \text{if } j \in L,\\
    A_{ij}, & \text{otherwise},
    \end{cases}
    \)
  </div>

  <p>
    where \(\alpha > 1\) is an amplification factor. This simply <em>boosts</em> the influence originating from leaders.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, let’s say leaders have direct control over the input \(u(t)\) at each time step. We can represent this as:
  </p>

  <div class="center_me">
    \(
    u(t)
    \;=\;
    \mathbf{e}_{\ell_1} \,u_{\ell_1}(t)
    \;+\;
    \mathbf{e}_{\ell_2} \,u_{\ell_2}(t)
    \;+\;\cdots
    \)
  </div>

  <p>
    where \(\mathbf{e}_{\ell_k}\) is a one-hot vector that indicates leader node \(\ell_k\) is broadcasting that new
    piece of informational content at time \(t\). Leaders and repeated signals are thus unified in a clean mathematical
    form.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2. In-Groups, Group Resonance, and “Echo Chambers”</h2>

  <p>
    The notion of an <strong>in-group</strong> is fundamental to social psychology. We trust (or pay attention to)
    messages more if they come from our own group. We can reflect this in our model by having a <em>block structure</em>
    in the adjacency matrix or by adding a <em>group resonance factor</em> that amplifies internal signals.
  </p>

  <h3>2.1 Partitioning the Network</h3>

  <p>
    Suppose the population of \(n\) nodes is divided into \(G\) groups, \(G_1, G_2, \dots, G_G\). Conceptually
    reordering nodes, the adjacency matrix \(A\) can take a block form:
  </p>

  <div class="center_me">
    \(
    A
    \;=\;
    \begin{bmatrix}
    A^{(1,1)} & A^{(1,2)} & \cdots & A^{(1,G)} \\
    A^{(2,1)} & A^{(2,2)} & \cdots & A^{(2,G)} \\
    \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
    A^{(G,1)} & A^{(G,2)} & \cdots & A^{(G,G)}
    \end{bmatrix}.
    \)
  </div>

  <p>
    Here, each block \(A^{(p,q)}\) corresponds to how members of group \(G_q\) influence members of group \(G_p\).
    Often, we see:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Stronger diagonal blocks</strong> (\(A^{(p,p)}\)): high in-group connectivity.</li>
    <li><strong>Weaker off-diagonal blocks</strong> (\(A^{(p,q)}\)): lower cross-group influence.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This reflects the presence of “echo chambers,” where in-group signals resonate more strongly than outside signals.
  </p>

  <h3>2.2 A “Group Resonance Operator”</h3>

  <p>
    We can also refine the <em>Emotional Sensitivity Operator</em> \(\Psi\) from the previous post by introducing a
    <strong>Group Resonance Operator</strong> \(\Gamma\). Specifically,
  </p>

  <div class="center_me">
    \(
    \Gamma\bigl(x_i(t), \{u(\tau)\}_{\tau=0}^t; i \in G_p\bigr)
    \;=\;
    \beta_p
    \;
    \Psi\!\Bigl(x_i(t), \{u(\tau)\}_{\tau=0}^t\Bigr),
    \)
  </div>

  <p>
    where \(\beta_p > 0\) is the <em>resonance factor</em> for group \(p\). If repeated signals also originate within
    the same group \(p\), \(\beta_p\) can be even larger (or conversely smaller for out-group signals). Intuitively:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    If you and I belong to the same group, your repeated messages <strong>resonate</strong> more for me than if we
    belonged to different groups.
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. Extending the Propaganda Operator</h2>

  <p>
    Let’s now modify the <strong>Propaganda Operator</strong> \(\mathcal{P}\) from before to include leaders and
    in-group resonance:
  </p>

  <div class="center_me">
    \(
    \mathbf{x}(t+1)
    \;=\;
    \mathcal{P}\!\Bigl(\mathbf{x}(t),\{u(\tau)\}\Bigr)
    \;=\;
    A^{(\mathrm{lead})}\,\mathbf{x}(t)
    \;+\;
    B\,\Gamma\bigl(\cdot,\{u(\tau)\}\bigr).
    \)
  </div>

  <p>
    Here:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>\(A^{(\mathrm{lead})}\) is the original \(A\) but with leader amplification.</li>
    <li>\(B\) is the matrix that distributes the emotional push to each node (just as in the previous post).</li>
    <li>\(\Gamma\) modifies \(\Psi\) based on group membership—“resonance” for in-group signals.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Leaders can now <em>choose</em> the repeated signals over time, and they know these signals are amplified through
    \(A^{(\mathrm{lead})}\) and further reinforced by in-group resonance factors \(\beta_p\).
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Surprising Equilibria and Phase Transitions</h2>

  <p>
    A central theme in non-violent propaganda is the <em>gradual buildup</em> of sentiment. However, with leaders and
    in-groups in the mix, the social system can display <strong>bistability, abrupt flips, or “phase
      transitions”</strong> as certain parameters (e.g., repetition rate or leader intensity) cross thresholds.
  </p>

  <h3>4.1 Bistability Due to Resonance</h3>

  <p>
    Consider a group \(G_p\) with a large resonance factor \(\beta_p\). If a leader within that group relentlessly
    broadcasts high-intensity repeated signals, the group’s internal state might climb to a “high” emotional
    equilibrium. If the signals cease (or the leader is discredited), that same group could <em>drop back</em> to a
    lower equilibrium. Both equilibria might satisfy
  </p>

  <div class="center_me">
    \(
    \mathbf{x}^*_{\text{low}},
    \quad
    \mathbf{x}^*_{\text{high}}
    \quad\text{such that}\quad
    \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x}^*_{\text{low}}) = \mathbf{x}^*_{\text{low}},
    \quad
    \mathcal{P}(\mathbf{x}^*_{\text{high}}) = \mathbf{x}^*_{\text{high}}.
    \)
  </div>

  <p>
    This is <em>bistability</em>. The group’s “resting state” depends on initial conditions and whether a leader
    <em>maintains</em> repeated messaging long enough to push the group out of the low equilibrium.
  </p>

  <h3>4.2 Sudden Flips via Leader Coordination</h3>

  <p>
    If multiple in-group leaders <em>coordinate</em>, especially in a network with multiple echo chambers, we can see
    <strong>network-wide “tipping”</strong>. Two or more groups might remain in a calm state if only one leader is
    pushing signals. But if each in-group is “activated” simultaneously by its own leader, the bridging connections
    between groups might suddenly lock the entire population into a new, higher emotional equilibrium.
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <strong>Intuitive Picture</strong>: Think of two separate “buckets” being filled. Each group’s internal state rises
    under repeated signals. Once they’re both heavy enough, the small links between them can propagate that heightened
    emotion across the network, causing a <em>rapid cascade</em>.
  </blockquote>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. Mini Case Study: Two-Group Network</h2>

  <p>
    To illustrate, consider a network of two groups (<strong>G1</strong> and <strong>G2</strong>) each with a leader.
    Suppose:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Both groups have a high resonance factor (\(\beta_1 = \beta_2 = 2.0\)).</li>
    <li>Leaders have amplification \(\alpha = 2.0\) in \(A^{(\mathrm{lead})}\).</li>
    <li>Each leader broadcasts a repeated signal daily.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Initially, everyone’s emotional state is near zero (calm). However, after a few days of <em>both leaders
      broadcasting</em>, synergy between the two in-groups can suddenly <strong>tip the system</strong> into a high
    emotional state—<em>even though neither group alone</em> would have had enough force to shift the entire network on
    its own. This demonstrates a non-violent but <em>powerful</em> dynamic driven by <em>leader coordination</em>.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. A Toy Simulation in Python</h2>

  <p>
    Below is a simplified Python snippet showing how leader amplification and in-group resonance might be implemented.
    This mirrors the style from our previous post but highlights the new elements:
  </p>

  <pre><code class="language-python">
# /// script
# dependencies = [
#   "numpy",
# ]
# ///

import numpy as np

# Number of nodes
n = 6

# Assign groups: 0,1,5 -> Group 1; 2,3,4 -> Group 2
groups = {
    0: 1,
    1: 1,
    2: 2,
    3: 2,
    4: 2,
    5: 1
}

# Base adjacency matrix (no leader amplification yet)
A = np.array([
    [0.4, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.0, 0.0],
    [0.0, 0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3, 0.0],
    [0.1, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.3]
])

# Leaders in each group
leaders = [0, 2]
alpha = 2.0

# Leader-amplified matrix
A_lead = A.copy()
for ln in leaders:
    A_lead[:, ln] *= alpha

# Emotional sensitivity operator (saturating)
def Psi(x, signal):
    return 0.5 * (x + np.tanh(signal))

# Group resonance operator
def Gamma(x_i, sum_signal, node_i, groups, beta_dict):
    g = groups[node_i]
    return beta_dict[g] * Psi(x_i, sum_signal)

# Resonance factors
beta_dict = {1: 1.8, 2: 1.8}

# Time evolution
T = 20
x = np.zeros((T+1, n))
x[0] = np.random.rand(n) * 0.1  # small random start

# Each leader broadcasts the same repeated signal intensity = 2.0
u_leader = {0: 2.0, 2: 2.0}

for t in range(T):
    # 1) Diffusion step
    x_diff = A_lead @ x[t]
    
    # 2) Emotional "push" from repeated signals
    x_emotion = np.zeros(n)
    for i in range(n):
        # approximate the repeated signal as (t+1) * intensity from each leader
        sum_signal = 0.0
        for ln, intensity in u_leader.items():
            sum_signal += (t+1) * intensity
        
        # Apply group resonance
        x_emotion[i] = Gamma(x[t][i], sum_signal, i, groups, beta_dict)
    
    x[t+1] = x_diff + x_emotion

print("Final emotional states after repeated signals:")
print(x[-1])
</code></pre>

  <p>
    By varying \(\alpha\), \(\beta_p\), or each leader’s broadcast intensity, you may see the system converge to a
    <em>low</em> emotional state or a <em>high</em> emotional state—sometimes flipping abruptly if both leaders
    coordinate sufficiently.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Big-Picture Implications</h2>

  <p>
    So why does any of this matter from a broader standpoint?
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Leaders and echo chambers</strong> create conditions where purely informational strategies (zero
      violence) can have outsized effects.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiple equilibria</strong> and sudden “tips” challenge simplistic, linear predictions of how opinions
      evolve.</li>
    <li><strong>Ethical dilemmas</strong>: Coordinating leaders or influencers could shift an entire network’s emotional
      baseline without violence, raising questions about the responsible use (or misuse) of such tactics.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Non-violent propaganda becomes <em>even subtler</em> under these conditions. Repeated signals, amplified by leaders
    and reinforced by in-group resonance, can drive large-scale shifts in collective mindsets.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>8. Conclusion and Future Directions</h2>

  <p>
    By weaving <strong>leaders</strong> and <strong>in-groups</strong> into our original framework, we uncover:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Amplified influence</strong> from leader nodes can bias social dynamics.</li>
    <li><strong>Echo chambers</strong> can exhibit multiple stable equilibria or abrupt flips.</li>
    <li><strong>Coordinated non-violent signals</strong> can “tip” entire networks unexpectedly.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Future avenues include exploring <em>competing propaganda</em> (multiple factions trying to influence the same
    network), <em>stochastic signals</em> (where leaders vary their intensity unpredictably), or even <em>switching
      group identities</em> over time (as individuals move across social boundaries).
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, understanding these dynamics is key to recognizing—and potentially mitigating—<strong>the potency of
      non-violent propaganda</strong> when wielded by influential leaders within tightly knit communities.
