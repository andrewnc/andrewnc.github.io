Lancer imagines a future where a survivor humanity has spread to the stars after weathering terrible ecological collapse on Earth - the end of the Anthropocene as a consequence of unrestrained consumption and poor stewardship. Five thousand years later, humanity lives in the wake of a desperate revolution, one where the victorious radicals now manage the galaxy they've won.
The settingfeatures a mix of gritty, mud-and-lasers military science fiction and mythic science fantasy, where conscript pilots mix ranks with flying aces, mercenary guns-for-hire brawl with secretive corpro-state agents, and relativistic paladins cross thermal lances with causality-breaking, unknowablebeings. Lancer's galaxy is one where utopia exists, but is under threat, and the struggle is not yet entirely won; the revolution is not yet done.
In Lancer, players adopt the roles of mechanized chassis pilots - mech pilots - comrades together in a galaxy of danger and hope. Some groups will fight to rectify the crimes of previous administrations; others will fight for their nation, pieces in a greater game of hegemony. Others will carry the banner ofa corpro-state or mercenary company, working to advance private interests while lining their pockets. Others still will fight for groups acting in opposition to those in power - for the underground, for the forgotten, agents of entropy and agents of yet more radical revolutions.
Lancer offers deep, modular mech customization, a wide range of player backgrounds and hooksto prompt storytelling, and a system and setting with room for any narrative you and your group want to tell. Its best with a group of 3-5 players, and can be used to run a one-shot session or persistent campaign.
#
Included with the PDF of the Lancer Core Book are the following:
Full, original art from some of the best illustrators working in indie comics, concept design, product design, and character design today.Full, deep setting information, GM toolkit, and back-end information to help you plan out your own Lancer narrative.Essentially limitless amounts of possible gear combinations to outfit your pilot's chassis.

<p>Summed up in a single word, it would be beautiful. David Wolinsky, Common Sense Media
An introspective Oregon Trail David G. Allan, CNN
A remarkable experiment in translation. As contemplative as its source material, it forces an anti-reflexive pace and coddles at its center an appreciation of calm and quiet.  Jason Sheehan, NPR Reading the Game

Play as philosopher and naturalist Henry David Thoreau in his experiment in self-reliant living at Walden Pond. Live off the land, seek out the small wonders and beauties of the woods, and find balance between your need to survive and your desire to find inspiration.


Walden, a game is a six hour, exploratory narrative that begins in the summer of 1845 when Thoreau moved to the Pond and built his cabin there. You follow in his footsteps, surviving in the woods by finding food and fuel and maintaining your shelter and clothing.

	At the same time as you strive to survive off the land, you are encouraged to explore the beauty of the woods and the pond, which hold a promise of a sublime life beyond your basic needs. And, you can interact with characters from Thoreau's life including mentor Ralph Waldo Emerson, sister Sophia Thoreau, editor Horace Greeley, activist A. Bronson Alcott, naturalist Louis Agassiz among others.

The game follows the loose narrative of Thoreau's first year in the woods, with each season holding its own challenges for survival and possibilities for inspiration. It features the voices of Emile Hirsch (Into the Wild, Milk) as Henry David Thoreau, Jim Cummings (Darkwing Duck, Sonic the Hedgehog) as Ralph Waldo Emerson, Misty Lee (The Last of Us, BioShock Infinite), and Tony Amendola (Stargate SG-1, Once Upon a Time) as Bronson Alcott.
Walden, a game has been a labor of love by a very small core team working over the past ten years. We sincerely hope you enjoy the experience and welcome your feedback! If you are an educator and would like to use Walden in your classroom, please contact us via our support form.

<p>A Mortician's Tale takes about 1 hour to play. It's a short, but deeply meaningful experience.
A Mortician's Tale is a story-driven death positive video game where you play as a mortician tasked with running a funeral home. Take on the role of recent funeral direction graduate Charlie as she learns the ropes of the business and industry. Prepare the bodies of the deceased (via embalming or cremation), attend their funerals and listen to their loved ones' stories, and interact with Charlie's coworkers, clients, and bosses.
A Mortician's Tale is an informative, honest, and sometimes humorous look at the current state of and the future of the western death industry.
Reviews
One Of 2017's Best Games... It elicits dark feelings, but asks players to consider where those feelings came from and what makes them dark.Kotaku
One Of Polygon's Best Games of 2017  "The video game industry is built on the destruction of bodies of all kinds. How refreshing to play a game that asks you to care for them, even after their life has left." Polygon
82/100  An approachable and thought-provoking meditation on lifes only certainty.PC GamerRecommended  This is a beautiful game. It scared me. It moved me. Most of all, it made me stop what I was doing and think.EuroGamer
"8/10  [A Mortician's Tale] is a short game, only an hour or so long, but it leaves an impact far beyond its runtime. Give it a chance, and it might just change the way you think about death."Destructoid

Beacon follows the journey of space privateer, Freja Akiyama, on her endless search for her crashed ships emergency distress beacon. In your search youll not only find weapons and items to help you; youll also be collecting DNA from the enemies you defeat. When you inevitably die, youre given the opportunity to integrate the DNA you've collected into your genome, allowing you to alter your statistics and gain gameplay-altering physical mutations for your next clone's life.
In the search for the Beacon, new questions arise; just how many clones of Freja are there? How long has she been stuck in an infinite cycle of survival? How much of her humanity will be sacrificed before escaping?Beacon is currently in Early Access, with the complete game (Patch 3.0)releasing later in 2020! Patch 3.0 will include Level 6, Boss Mutations, and the final Act 2 Bosses.


5 Randomly Generated Levels -- Enter at the outer forest, fight your way through the tropical swamps, and push through the pollution to the cryptic Prism Vault where your Beacon is being heldA rich multi-faction world to scavenge -- Discover the mysteries behind the planet Kovus 18, find tinkered Weapon Variants left behind by previous clones, and track your percentage of secrets found at the end of each level75+ Mutations -- Gain new abilities with each death and alter your character into something not quite human60+ Enemies with 8 Champion Variants -- The varied factions that inhabit Kovus 18 will fight each other as well as you100+ Weapons -- Spread across 5 factions each with their own unique technologies150+ Items Spread Across 4 Item Types -- Regain an advantage with one time use Pickups, activate your re-useable Auxiliary, swap your Grenade Mod, and stock up on Passive Mods12 Unique Weather Types with Storm Events -- Avoid or make use of Hailshards, Tesla Storms, and Polluted Tornadoes7 Act 1 Boss Fights -- Including the Solus Hivemind, Excavation Spider, and Tritoraptor Matriarch


DNA is the core of Beacons gameplay loop. Through the use of Frejas state-of-the-art Clone Bay and DNA dropped by deceased enemies, upon death youre given the opportunity to alter your genetic makeup, changing your statistics before a fresh clone is printed back at the beginning of the game. Each faction has their own set of unique DNA and mutations, allowing you to become a battle-hardened mass of metal, a luminous abomination of insect flesh, or anything inbetween.



The planet you've crashed on is unfamiliar. Theonly information available is its name  Kovus-18  as it flashes upon your Visorsys OS; the rest of the record is blank. It seems that either nothing isknown about it, or whatever was known has been scrubbed from the database. Multiple factions populate its surface, each seemingly at war with the others, and all of them hostile to the planet's newest inhabitant you.



In Beacon, you play as Freja Akiyama. Having grown up in the backwaters of civilised space, Freja always dreamed of adventure. Enrolling in the military at a young age, she quickly discovered both her natural abilities for combat and piloting spacecraft, and her inability to work within the strict regimen of the armed forces. Freja lives and works aboard her ship, the Ouroboros  a single-berth, heavily-modified light spacecraft that boasts state-of-the-art weaponry and facilities.

<p>RETAIL IS HELL.

It's your first day on the job and the store is closing in a matter on minutes. The consumers, with their unrelenting thirst for customer service are still prowling the aisles and there are shelves still to be stocked up. The store needs to be kept in pristine condition, and empty shelves will not be tolerated by The Manager. Welcome to hell.

<p>In Airships: Conquer the Skies you'll need to use all of your creativity and skill to design and build fearsome airships and land vehicles to give you the edge in massive aerial battles.
Construct your vehicles by piecing together a vast array of modules, choosing weapons, armour types, structures, equipment and resources in near endless configurations to allow you to prevail against even the toughest foes.
The vehicles are highly detailed, teeming with sailors moving around performing their individual tasks to stay in the fight. Your choices of vehicle layouts are crucial, exploring the design space of different crafts and their matching tactics to make sure your fleet emerges victorious.
Once your vehicles are ready for the fight, youll give high-level commands to your small fleet, swooping, soaring, ramming and boarding others to gain the upper hand in battle. Ships and terrain are fully destructible: they can catch fire, explode, break apart, and fall, so youll need to choose your tactics wisely.
Face off against giant aerial kraken, fleshcracker mechs, huge venomous spiders, clockwork wasps, and more. Defeat them and reap the rewards.
Play across three distinctly different modes: taking on (or creating your own) bespoke Missions; building a mighty empire in Conquest, or destroying your friends in Multiplayer matches online or via LAN.

<p>Hex Kit is a multi-platform desktop application for building hex maps to be used with table top role playing games. Rather than being bogged down by features and complications, Hex Kit is built to be intuitive and quick to use with an emphasis on art.
Features:
Multi Platform: Hex Kit runs native on Windows, Mac, and Linux.Simple to Use: It has just the right tools you need to quickly put together a detailed map, as well as a few tools for displaying your map at the table.Detail Variation: No need to hand pick each tile as you build your map; pick a hex style and the software randomizes the selection as you click and drag across the canvas. Tiles can be rotated and flipped with just a few mouse clicks as well. If you find the painting too broad, you can also select individual tiles.Player Facing Display: Hex Kit has a display mode that shows your map in a separate window; drag it to a second screen or show it on a projector. You can hide parts of the map with fog of war and reveal the map as needed. Changes made in paint mode update in the display window in real time. Did your players burn that village down? Delete it from the map, and it's gone.Store Information: You can store a label with a description for each hex directly in the map.Custom Tiles: Hex Kit comes with a small selection of old school themed, black & white tiles that you can use to get started. You can create and import your own tiles, purchase and install official tile sets illustrated by CONE team members, install tile sets from 3rd parties, or even cobble together tiles made from images found around the internet!Export: Hex Kit will export your map as a PNG file that you can print or even use with a virtual table top.Random Maps: If you're in a hurry, or just want to goof off, you can generate a random map and then edit it to fit your needs. You can even save your generator to use again later.Internal API / Plugin Support:Hex Kit boasts in internal API; users willing to dig in to a little bit of JavaScript can create, run, and share plugins to get an extra mile out of Hex Kit. Documentation on Hex Kit plugins can be found here, and an example plugin can be found here.Both Types Of Maps: Hex Kit now supports tiles that either have points up or faces up.
Installation: Installing Hex Kit is easy: download the zip file and extract it wherever you want. All you have to do is open the executable and you'll be making maps in no time. Note: Hex Kit is not compatible with the Itch Client.
FAQ: This can be found at http://coneofnegativeenergy.com/hexkit/faq/
Tutorial: This can be found at http://coneofnegativeenergy.com/hexkit/help/
More Tiles: You can get some fancy new tiles like the ones used to make the map below, right here: https://cone.itch.io/. Again, the tiles in the image below do not come packaged with Hex Kit, and are available separate!


IMPORTANT NOTE: Screenshots on this page depict the default black and white tiles as well as imported tiles. Hex Kit only comes with black & white tiles, additional tiles can be downloaded or purchased.
Terms of Use: By purchasing or downloading Hex Kit you agree to the terms listed here: http://coneofnegativeenergy.com/hexkit/tos/ (Please read.)</p></li>

2064: Read Only Memories merges old-school adventure gaming with modern storytelling to explore some of the social challenges we will face in the near future. Explore the colorful future metropolis of Neo-San Francisco, meeting a huge cast of fascinating characters and solving a far-reaching mystery. Think carefully about your choices, because you never know how they will affect this dynamic, branching narrative further down the line.

The world is changing.
Genetic alteration of humans is now commonplace, with many choosing to radically alter their bodies to express their individuality. Virtual intelligences called ROMs (Relationship and Organizational Managers), created as simple digital assistants, are exerting greater control over peoples lives. Some are terrified by this rapid change, and they are willing to go to extreme lengths to prevent it.

A lost ROM named Turing breaks into the apartment of a struggling journalist to ask for help. They claim to be the first sapient machinenot a simulation of life but a genuinely self-aware artificial beingand the technical genius who created them has gone missing. Can you unravel the shocking conspiracy that threatens to rock an entire society? Or will the darkness that lies behind the bright neon lights of Neo-SF consume you?

Old-school, cutting-edge - Classic point-and-click adventuring inspired by the likes of Gabriel Knight and Snatcher is melded with modern branching storytelling that delves into identity, individuality, and what it means to be human.People of the future - Get to know a diverse cross-section of Neo-SFs population, brought to life by some of the best voice talent working in games today, including Melissa Hutchison and Dave Fennoy (The Walking Dead), Erin Yvette (Oxenfree), Austin Creed (WWEs Xavier Woods), and internet stars Jim Sterling (Jimquisition) and SungWon Cho (ProZD).High tech nostalgia - The city of Neo-San Francisco is rendered in beautiful pixel art, and your adventure is accompanied by a catchy low-fi electronic synth soundtrack.Solve the mystery - Enjoy over ten hours of adventure gaming goodness, featuring exploration, dynamic branching conversations, multiple endings, and many challenges to overcome.The definitive PC edition - Since its launch two years ago, the team has made many improvements and additions to an already amazing game, making this the ultimate version. Additions have included new characters and voice performers, additional facial animations, Japanese language support, and the Endless Christmas extended epilogue that allows you to hang out with your favorite Neo-SF locals.
More about the Sights & Sounds of Neo-SF Deluxe Edition

Sights of Neo-SF (Artbook)


	The world of 2064 can be hard to navigate. The Sights of Neo-SF is the official art book by Read Only Memories director and lead artist John "JJSignal" James. Highly stylized and specific in its visuals, ROM's progression from early sketches to final form is fully outlined in this 50-page PDF. You will see early concepts fully realized, previous versions of your favorite characters and even some characters that didn't make the final cut. JJ lists Bubblegum Crisis, Akira, Megazone 23, and the Pluto manga as his biggest style inspirations. Come see where the ideas behind the game began and watch them evolve into the vibrant city of Neo-SF we know and love.
	


Sounds of Neo-SF (Soundtrack)


	Composed by 2 Mello, the Sounds Of Neo-SF is the FM-synthy, funky, and positively-charged soundtrack to MidBoss' cyberpunk adventure game Read Only Memories. Not content with a soundtrack that was merely fitting for its game, 2 Mello crafted these sounds to embody the dual nature of Neo-San Francisco, all its charm and its hidden dangers. But who said that our cyberpunk future has to be dark and dreary? You'll be humming these melodies to 2064 and beyond.</p></li>

<p>Come away, O human child! To the waters and the wild with a faery, hand in hand,for the worlds more full of weeping than you can understand.
~ W.B. Yeats
Description


Changeling is a non-stat raising, full-length visual novel about love, reconciliation, and trying to survive in a dangerous supernatural world. Play through about 30-40 hours of content and over 40 unique endings while trying to survive the perils of a newly discovered paranormal community. Romance one of 6 love interests as you uncover information about the supernatural and the secrets from your own past - all while you try to patch up your relationship with your twin brother who grows more and more suspicious of you with each passing day.



Story

The human world acceptedas reality is only a thin veneer under which lies a world of supernatural creatures, entities, and people. They live beside humans hiding their nature or walking among them unseen. And most people go about their lives entirely unaware of the dangers around them. Mysterious situations are written off as fake, or they're glossed over with some sort of mundane explanation. 

The same was true for Nora, a normal girl struggling with the usual litany of everyday problems - including her crumbling relationship with an angry, resentful twin brother with whom she's nearly given up on reconciling. 

But her family's return to the town in which she'd grown up set in motion a chain of events that would shatter every illusion she had about a world she thought she knew. Her eyes newly opened to the truth around her, Nora begins a journey to uncover the secrets of her own mysterious past and the reason for her brother's bitter hatred toward her. Alongside her best friend, and a group of unusual guys she met after her return, Nora begins to chip away at the lies shrouding her life. Lies that have been haunting her since childhood.

But in a world where Vampires, Werewolves, and Faeries are real, learning the truth may come at a high cost.

So what's so great about DragonRuby Game Toolkit?
Dirt simple apiscapable ofcreatingcomplex 2D games.Fast as hell. Powered by highly optimized C code written by Ryan C. Gordon, the creator of SDL (a library that powers every commercial game engine in the world).Battle tested by Amir Rajan, a critically acclaimed indie game dev.Tiny. Like really tiny. The entire engine is a few megabytes.Hot loaded, realtime coding, optimized to provide constant feedback to the dev. Productive and an absolute joy to use.Turn key builds for Windows, MacOS, and Linux with seamlesspublishing to Itch.io.Cross platform: PC, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android, Nintendo Switch, XBOX One, and PS4 (mobile and console compilation requires a business entity, NDA verification, and a Professional GTK License, contact us).
Ryan put together a 5-minute intro to DragonRuby GTK, to give you a whirlwind tour of the big ideas:


This is a tech demo sample app that ships with DragonRuby. The GTK's entire API is displayed here.

The developers behind DragonRuby GTK.

This is Ryan C. Gordon (Wikipedia), he is one of the juggernauts behind Simple DirectMedia Layer (Wikipedia).
Ya know...
SDL.
that low level library that powers literally every commercial game engine out there?
He's also worked on porting a number of games to Linux and Mac OS: such as Braid, Super Meat Boy, Dear Esther, and LIMBO.


And this is Amir Rajan, he is an indie game dev with titles on iOS, Android, desktop,and Nintendo Switch...amassing 4 million downloads and counting (Nintendo, Kill Screen, The New Yorker). And yes, all these games are built with the DragonRuby Runtime.

Both of these guys hate the complexity of today's engines. And as luck would have it, their paths ended up crossing. After six months and 50,000 lines of DragonRuby Runtime enhancements,Ryan and Amir now have a live/hot loadable, cruft-free, productive game enginethat can target... well... any gaming device you can think of.
Hello World is one file, three lines.

This is all you need to create a game. One file. One method called tick. Here we render thecurrent step value as a label: 

def tick args
  args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, args.state.tick_count]
end


That's it. If you know how to use the array datatype in any language, you know how to use the DragonRuby Game Toolkit. Here's the proof right here, play around with the enginein your browser.
Output: Six rendering primitives is all you need.
Here are the six draw primitives you need to know: solids, sprites, labels, lines, borders, and sounds. Here is how you use them:

def tick args  
  # draw a blue square that's half way faded out
  args.outputs.solids << [100, 100, 50, 50, 0, 0, 255, 128]
  
  # draw a red label  
  args.outputs.labels << [100, 100, "This is a label.", 255, 0, 0]
  
  # draw a sprite turned 45 degrees and half way faded out
  args.outputs.sprites << [200, 200, 50, 50, 'ninja.png', 45, 128]
  
  # draw a diagonal green line from bottom left to top right
  args.outputs.lines << [0, 0, 1280, 720, 0, 255, 0]
  
  # draw a black border (unfilled square)
  args.outputs.borders << [100, 100, 50, 50, 0, 0, 0, 255]
  
  # play a sound every second
  args.outputs.sounds << "ping.wav" if args.state.tick_count % 60 == 0
end
That's it. You now know the entire render api for DragonRuby GTK.

Here's a more complicated example.This is how you create a night time scene, with a title, and a ninja:
solids: A black background, and two hundred stars made of tiny squares.labels: Display some smokey-white text.sounds: Play a sound when the game starts up.sprites: Render a sprite on the screen.lines: Draw a line representing the floorborders: Frame the entire scenewith a white border.

def tick args
  # destructure args into local variables
  state, outputs, grid = args.state, args.outputs, args.grid
  # set some default values for the game
  state.colors.background ||= [0, 0, 0]
  state.colors.star       ||= [128, 200, 255]
  state.colors.text       ||= [200, 200, 200]
  state.colors.landmarks  ||= [255, 255, 255]
  state.night             ||= [grid.rect, state.colors.background]
  state.stars             ||= 200.map do
    [rand * grid.w,
     rand * grid.h,
     rand * 2 + 2,
     rand * 2 + 2,
     state.colors.star]
  end
  # start up some background music
  outputs.sounds  << "opening_fx.wav" if state.tick_count == 0
  # render the background and stars
  outputs.solids  << state.night
  outputs.solids  << state.stars
  # set a title for the game
  outputs.labels  << [grid.left + 50, grid.top  - 50, 
                      "Ninja Game", state.colors.text]
  # set a sprite
  outputs.sprites << [50, 50, 50, 50, 'ninja.png']
  # create a line that represents the ground
  outputs.lines   << [grid.left, 
                      grid.bottom + 50, 
                      grid.right, 
                      grid.bottom + 50, 
                      state.colors.landmarks]
  # create a border to frame the game
  outputs.borders << [grid.left + 1,
                      grid.bottom + 1, 
                      grid.right - 1, 
                      grid.top - 1, 
                      state.colors.landmarks]
end
Input: Controllers, Mouse, and Keyboard.
This is how you move a sprite using your gamepad:

args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
args.outputs.sprites << [args.state.ninja.x, 300,
                         50, 50,
                         'ninja.png']
if args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.right
  args.state.ninja.x += 10
elsif args.inputs.controller_one.key_held.left
  args.state.ninja.x -= 10
end

This is how you move a sprite using your mouse:

args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
args.outputs.sprites << [
   args.state.ninja.x, 
   300, 
   50, 
   50, 
   'ninja.png'
]
if args.inputs.mouse.click  
  args.state.ninja.x = args.inputs.mouse.click.point.x
end
This is how you move a sprite using your keyboard:

args.state.ninja.x ||= 100
args.outputs.sprites << [args.state.ninja.x, 300, 50, 50, 
                         'ninja.png']
if args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.right
  args.state.ninja.x += 10
elsif args.inputs.keyboard.key_held.left
  args.state.ninja.x -= 10
end
Game State: Entities and Collision.

Randomly create 500ninjas on the screen. Create a lookup table that contains the alpha property of ninjas that have collided. Present all ninjas with their alpha properties set.

def tick args
  # destructure args into local variables
  grid, state, outputs = args.grid, args.state, args.outputs
  
  # use Game Toolkit's built in helper methods to create
  # adhoc entities
  state.ninjas ||= 500.map do
    state.new_entity(:ninja,
                    { rect: [grid.w.-(50) * rand,
                             grid.h.-(50) * rand,
                             50,
                             50] })
  end
  # use Ruby's powerful apis to determine collision
  state.collisions ||= state.ninja
                            .product
                            .reject { |n, n2| n == n2 }
                            .find_all { |n, n2| n.rect.intersects_rect?(n2.rect) }
                            .map { |n, _| [n.entity_id, 128] }
                            .pairs_to_hash
  #render everything to the screen
  outputs.sprites << state.ninjas.map do |n|
    [n.rect, 'dragonruby.png', 0,
     state.collisions[n.entity_id] || 255]
  end
end

PressThe work youre celebrating and documenting here feels as much yours as the creators, and these shots of vanished worlds acquire a poignance no save file would match.Kotaku UK
Games like Quiet as a Stone remind me of how beautiful and genuinely cool is it to be so engrossed with an artificial space. Ive gone from level to level until Ive found the perfect arrangement of ruins, zooming in close to admire them before framing them with my camera with the perfect combination of distance, light, and color. It helped me to see the beauty in small things: the errant blade of grass that slid into view, a serendipitously-shaped rock heap, the flickering heat of a fire slithering through mist. And it was all right at my fingertips.Kotaku US
Sometimes I plant gardens, build ruins, and erect mysterious circles of monoliths. Sometimes I look around the different landscapes, watching day and night and rain and shine come and go. Sometimes I just click on stuff to cut grass and smash gems because clicking is fun.Rock Paper ShotgunLinks

Reception
"Scenic water stretches and skyward spangles decorate idyllic countryside villages and moody, rain-drizzled night scenes. This is another one of those games I've flicked through the screenshots as if it were a global travel book outlining places you should visit before you die." - Chris Priestman, Indie Statik
"The game's sound design is the strongest facilitator of Anodyne's sense of dread and unease; the ambience and music give off an air of suspicion and danger, with ugly chords and disquieting, unnatural-sounding synthetic pings. It all adds up to a game where you're not sure who to trust, and you can't be sure of what's real." - Sam Prell, Penny Arcade Report
Please Note
The Mac version has flickering on fullscreen on some version of Mac OSX. Please play in windowed mode.Linux: Anodyne does not have an official Linux version, buy at your own risk - This is unsupported, a very old (but complete) version from 2013 or so.

Do not deviate from your routine. Suffer the Curse! Stick your scentflaps where you shouldn't, and you may just walk away with an ancient cranial entity haunting your every waking moment! Consult local Necresses, pray to the Nine Goddesses, purchase ritual objects, and rub the giant sword to balance your personal luck favorably! Maybe that will make the whispering stop! Embark on an anti-adventure! Find a middle ground between your life of menial drudgery and a culture of exciting quests and powerful heroes, and you might finally find a way off Xabran's Rock!

<p>Social Justice Warriors is a satirical role-playing game that translates the standard medieval fantasy heroes of role-playing games into social media crusaders facing an endless horde of ignorant internet trolls.

Social Justice Warriors Trailer
Social Justice Paladins duel foes with 140 characters or less while shrugging off attacks with a press of the Block button.Social Justice Clerics serve in the name of their patron sub-deity, summoning its divine power to smite their enemies. Social Justice Mages conjure powerful constructs of fact and opinion to alter minds and reality... while occasionally hurling a scathing fireball of a blog post. Social Justice Rogues fight fire with fire. Throw flurries of vitriolic character attacks then delete your accounts and withdraw into the shadows of the net.


Social Justice Warriors is a game about the dismissive labels people use to silence each other, including "social justice warrior" and "troll". No matter what social values you have, attacking and ridiculing other people not only fails to achieve progress but has an additional effect of escalating the conflict and wearing you down in the process.

The Space Between by Christoph Frey is a surreal short narrative experience in three acts about the walls we build for us.The architect Martin Melanson, commissioned to build a theater, meets a woman named Clara, outside of his apartment complex at night. Attracted to each other, they visit the theater's building site.While they explore the unfinished stage, surrounded by scaffolds and lost in thoughts, reality slowly fades, where the curtain opens and a dark play about closeness and separation begins.The game's drawn-out, static nature, embedded in blurred PS1 visuals, supports its surreal plot and dialogues to create a dreamlike 40 - 50 minute experience, that should be played in one sitting.Controls:W,A,S,D to moveMouse to lookE to interact"Overall, these stylistic choices come together in a thoroughly cohesive aesthetic whole, amplifying cinematic qualities similar to those of an Ingmar Bergman or Nicolas Winding Refn film."

<p>HIGHWAY BLOSSOMS REMASTERED
The update some of you asked for
Highway Blossoms: Remastered is the new definitive romance treasure hunt road trip experience. Most importantly, it's now fully voiced in English by a talented cast of actors. We've also remastered the soundtrack for a better listening experience, touched up the art for a better viewing experience, and added a Chinese translation for a better Chinese reading experience.


 
Highway Blossoms is a short yuri (lesbian) story set in the American Southwest. After an old gold rush miner's journal is discovered, supposedly detailing where he hid parts of his stash, a nationwide craze begins as would-be prospectors try to solve its clues and strike it rich. 
Amber couldn't care less. Wandering the desert in a recently-inherited motorhome, she mourns the loss of her grandfather - indifferent and unaware of the hunt happening around her. It's not until she meets Marina, a young hitchhiker lost in New Mexico that the girls get swept up in the rush. 
 

At least tens of words, maybe even hundreds. Although the last word count puts it around 90,000, so expect 6 or so hours of reading.Grand, hand-painted vistas of actual landmarks in the western United States, all in glorious 1080p detail. A huge soundtrack featuring the works of Anna Logue, Jake Abernathie, Able Kirby, and other friends. Sounds right at home on your in-dash cassette tape player. Accessibility options for days, including the ability to skip through everything in less than five minutes. But who would wanna do that?Alternate silly content for second readthroughs that the developers let the programmer write. This may or may not have been a good idea. *Warning: contains some strong language and dirty jokes*
There is a free patch available for the game that adds in the adult content. It is totally optional and is not necessary for completing all of the achievements in the game.Please note that applying this patch might make your previous save files unusable. Some people have had issues, others have not. You can hold ctrl to skip through previously read content at high speed though. HIGH SPEED FLOWER BLOOM.WARNING: By downloading and installing this mod and/or by accessing the highwayblossoms.com website, you certify that you are over the age of 18. This patch adds content that is not suitable for small children.Download at: http://highwayblossoms.com/hbadult/To install, simply paste 'adult.rpa' into "Highway Blossoms/game/"
REGARDING THE ANDROID VERSION: We have removed the Android version of the game as we are not able to upgrade it to the Remastered version and cannot continue supporting it. Thank you to everyone who downloaded and tried that version of the game.</p></li>

The story takes places at the end of the 70s  a time of terrorism, kidnappings, and political turmoil in Italy  and it will introduce you to that world and its dynamics thorough a cast of characters that you have never met in a video game. It's up to you to discover their motivations for driving along the coast of Italy and away from their homes.Based on your choices  and the places you'll decide to visit  you may end up in car chases, illegal street races, or in tense debates that will make you wonder who your travel companions really are.

<p>my granddad came home from the war a changed man. he was bitter, quick to anger and aggressive. he'd grown to hate animals too. should a dog yap, he'd rush to kick it.
how does one discuss such a person without being exploitative? perhaps we frame him as a product of external forces, a war perhaps, in effect making him blameless. I like to remember him with the aphorism, "you can't kick every barking dog."

<p>**UPDATE** Mac & PC Builds now have translated text in Spanish, French, German and the original English!Codemancer brings the mystery of magic and the exhilaration of learning to code together in a fantasy universe that uses spell casting as a way to teach and learn programming skills. Codemancers fantasy universe is filled with rival sorcerers and their minions for players to encounter along their journey. Codemancer is a non-violent, entertaining, and educational game designed to be inclusive and accessible to learners at any stage. Features include a gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and a programming interface thats designed to be easy to understand by kids with varying degrees of skill and experience. Codemancer breaks down barriers that may have discouraged some kids from embracing technology and elevates their screentime to be more productive and entertaining. It isnt a typical coding or technology game.
WHAT IS CODEMANCER ALL ABOUT?
Codemancer tells a moving story about Aurora, a young, creatively talented girl whos trying to grow up, become independent, and do good in the world in the face of incredible obstacles when her father is suddenly kidnapped. Aurora has to embark on an adventure to save him as she grows into a gracious and independent young woman. She must learn magic spells to save her father, but the magic used in Auroras world works the same as programming does in ours. Inspire children to explore their potential as they discover the magic of coding.
CODEMANCER IS AN EDUCATIONAL GAMING ADVENTURE:
Codemancer is designed for 6 to 12 year olds as an educational game that teaches the magic behind codingand can be fun for grownups, too!
CODEMANCER SPECIFICALLY TEACHES:
Sequential AlgorithmsDebuggingFunction ArgumentsScopeLooping ConstructsConcurrent Programming
...AND TEACHES IN GENERAL:
Computational ThinkingPlanningProblem SolvingResilience

CODEMANCER FEATURES:
A narrative inspired by popular works of young adult fantasy worlds such as Harry Potter, Percy Jackson, The Neverending Story, The Last Airbender, and many more!Gameplay that takes place in a hexagonal world, making it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye.'Freeze time' ability, so players can debug the programs they've written and potentially code their way out of a jam to learn from their mistakes.Availability for PC, Mac, iPad, and Android tablets.
CODEMANCER IS STRUCTURED FOR ACCESSIBILITY AND INCLUSIVITY:
The goal of Codemancer is to be as broadly inclusive as possible by creating a gender-neutral fantasy setting with a female protagonist, a narrative backbone, and language interface thats designed to make the game appeal to kids at different skill levels.Codemancer breaks down barriers that can hinder some kids from feeling comfortable with engaging with programming, for example Codemancer uses pips (like on a die) instead of numerals, and sets the gameplay in a hexagonal world that makes it easy to estimate distances and angles by eye.No syntax errors -- if you can enter a spell, it will run. Syntax errors can be frustrating and cause learners to quit before they really begin.Codemancer uses an open dyslexic font, where letters are designed to look distinctly different from each other to make reading easier for kids with dyslexia.The game is fully voiced, so reading is completely optional.Codemancer's programming language is designed to be accessible, but also translates easily to a variety of popular real-world programming languages (such as Python).Codemancer appeals to many educational groups, from children with special needs for reading, to younger children new to coding, to older children with more advanced coding and programming skill sets.Codemancer has the potential to reach under-represented groups in coding and teach them an often-exclusionary, but nonetheless important, 20th-century skill.

<p>Sleepaway gives us long hazy days, chilled summer nights, kids screaming and chasing fireflies, crackling campfires, and a gaunt, cruel monstrosity forever hiding just out of sight, always asking, What do you do next?
In Sleepaway, you play as a camp counselor at a not-so-ordinary summer camp besieged by a Strange and ominous cryptid. In the outside world, people grow increasingly alienated from their own identities, trapped in a miasma of advertising and corporate branding. Isolated from civilization, this summer camp is a beacon of safety, a refuge for misfit kids defined by their marginalization. As time pushes past and the world grows older, this camp also shelters the survivors of the Lindworm.
The Lindworm is a shapeshifter, or so the stories go; a creature that flays the skin of humans and hides within. As counselors of this summer camp, youve each been traumatized by the Lindworm, in your own ways.
You remember little of that time.
Just that you dont want anyone else to experience it either, and youll keep this camp safe no matter what.

Sleepawayis a breathtaking piece of design. At its core it is the straightforward give-and-take economy of Avery Alder's Belonging Outside Belonging system. Around that core, Jay has built an elegant and unsettling scaffold of poetic prompts, relatable archetypes, and bogey-monster horror that facilitate a truly terrifying experience.
  Eric Mersmann
Sleepawayuses the Belonging Outside Belonging system, popularized by games likeDream Askewby Avery Alder andDream Apartby Benjamin Rosenbaum. It is a diceless game where tokens are received for making Weak Moves (actions that make your life harder), and these tokens are spent on Strong Moves (actions that passionately succeed). In Belonging Outside Belonging games, everyone shares the role of facilitator, and each person can pick up Setting Elements to bounce off of and provide narrative impetus for the other players. In Sleepaway, Setting Elements also contain Rituals, in which gameplay becomes more abstracted, to highlight unique moments of play by combining them with real-world actions and activities. Rituals might invite you to draw, to gesticulate, to play music, or even to destroy elements of the game itself in very unique ways.
The story continues on this way, with characters interacting and setting elements providing a world to interact within, until it is time for the Lindworm to act. While everyone has their eyes closed, one player responsible for channeling the Lindworm during play draws from a deck of cards and causes an unsettling event to occur. These can range from a new scar in a place you didn't remember having one, to a brutally dismembered animal appearing at your cabin door, or potentially even the death or dismemberment of player characters as the game continue.
Characters, scenes, locations, items, and the Lindworm's cards are all kept track of on a conspiracy-style corkboard, which slowly becomes more entangled and more mechanically relevant over time.
The game is divided into three acts, each one with unique rules that subtly change the game by adding new setting elements, permanently changing setting elements and character sheets, and introducing new ways to play.

Sleepawaywas a simultaneous nostalgia trip and horrifying art project. From designing our land (inevitably just like land wed all been to) to interacting with fellow staff and campers, the whole experience deeply evoked my days at camp and the feeling of magic that came with them. These memories were like a canvas; on top of them we painted an atmospheric set of horrors, weaving scenes together out of remembrances and collective narrative understanding. At each point there was a sense that we all knew where the story should go - it was just a matter of following it there, of letting the Lindworm manifest it. It was satisfying and unique to layer dread on nostalgia, and I highly recommend it for anyone who remembers the magic of summer camp!
   MayaZiv
TheSleepawaybook is 130 pages long, and features gorgeous black and white illustrations by our talented team of artists and graphic designers, based on the natural flora and fauna of the Hudson Valley, where the author grew up and where the summer camp Sleepawayis based on is located.
The book has ten unique character sheets, a dozen setting elements for multiple stages of play, rules for both oneshots and campaign play, an enormous pile of rituals, and so much more! Follow the link down below to purchase a physical copy of theSleepaway book.

We each have fallen in love with the characters we build so fast, they feel like lovely little facets of ourselves; and the emphasis on struggle, of working through things, of making yourself vulnerable in order to be strong, has been so much fun and surprisingly healing.
    Vocea
WithSleepaway, Dragon takes the social mechanics of setting elements from Belonging outsideBelonging games, and eases them deftly into the setting - and into the ald itself. It's a syncretic wedding between the natural world, the people who tend it, and the supernatural forces that inhabit it.
    Caro
A beautiful PDFthat's possibly the best game in theBelonging Outside Belongingsystem. It does exactly what it says it does, excellently. Protect the campers. Cause drama. Get flayed by the Lindworm.

... the most genuinely realistic game ever made. It is like life: puzzling, difficult, uncertain, unclear, always seen, in St Pauls words, through a glass darkly.  Bryan Appleyard, The Sunday Times


The Night Journey (2007-2018)is one of the first experimental art games ever made. A collaboration between renowned media artist Bill Viola and designers at theUSC Game Innovation Lab, it uses both game and video techniques to tell the universal story of an individuals journey towards enlightenment.
After being exhibited around the world for the past decade, this foundational videogame artwork has nowcome to home platforms.Updated for this releasewith new, original dream footage, theproject stands as a milestone in the search to expand the boundaries of what game experiences may communicate through their game mechanics and world design.
About the experience:
The game begins in the center of a mysterious landscape on which darkness is falling. There is no one path to take, no single goal to achieve, but the players actions will reflect on themselves and the world, transforming and changing them both. If they are able, they may slow down time itself and forestall the fall of darkness. If not, there is always another chance; the darkness will bring dreams that enlighten future journeys.
The interactive design of The Night Journey evokes a sense of the archetypal journey of enlightenment through the mechanics of the game experience  i.e. the choices and actions of the player during the game. The game design explores a challenging question: what is the game mechanic of enlightenment? How can we model such an intensely personal yet archetypal experience in a game?
Visual inspiration is derived from the prior works of Bill Viola which provide reference for the game world, while source material for the in-game reflections is drawn from the vast archive of his video footage.Textual inspiration comes from the lives and writings of great historical figures including: Rumi, the 13th century Islamic poet and mystic; Rykan, the 18th century Zen Buddhist poet; St. John of the Cross, the 16th century Spanish mystic and poet; and Plotinus, the 3rd century philosopher.The team created a set of custom post-processing techniques for the 3D environment that give a sense of explorable video, integrating the imagery of Bill Violas prior work into the game world at both a technical and creative level.
The Night Journey was awarded "Most Sublime Experience" at the IndieCade Festival of Independent Games.

The game is ashort exploration/photography experience set in the idyllic forested landscape of the Wakamarina Valley, located near Queen Charlotte Sound on New Zealand's South Island.This project started out as a showcase of my work in environment design, I wanted to create a realistic, densely forested scene using photoscanned 3d assets that could run smoothly in real-time. The environment was created in Unreal Engine 4 with heavy reference to photos taken at the location, You'll encounter rocky riverbeds, dense forest paths, vast farmland and distant hills, a lot of which resemble the appearance of the real valley in NZ.
Some Extra Reccomendations:- Personalise the soundtrack! Feel free to pause the in-game music and play your own in the background.- The VR version is a great way to be immersed in the world but I'd still recommend the desktop version as the best way to experience the game.- Please try to avoid looking for online guides if you're feeling impatient. Often what you're looking for will only take a few extra minuites to discover.

May 2020 -The Remaster is here!Added lots of new visual elements, a new area, new assets,camera mechanics, revamped rainy alternate map, a flyable drone, remastered/reoptimised VR mode,and a whole bunch of new things to do. See thedevlogfor a full list of changes.Try my other exploration games:

Vilmonic is a living virtual world. Your goal is to bring life back from the brink of extinction.
Protect and breed unique pixel-art life forms whose pixels and color have meaning. Experiment with natural and artificial selection. Craft tools, construct buildings and change the environment. Uncover the secrets of the past as you dig up ancient tech and fend off the mindless haywire zombitons.

Don't be fooled by the SUPER CUTE look, Vilmonic is a deep and complex ARTIFICIAL LIFE SIMULATOR!
Evolving genetic code generates each creature's pixel-art body.
The shape, or morphology, of each animatroid or fungol is determined by its genes. Genes control the bending of internalbonesorbranches. Pixels cover the bones to create the shape of the body. The shape of the body and the number of different pixels determine thephysiologyof the life form.
Pixels and body shape determine biological function:hydration, nutrient use, movement, perception...
Each life form has a metabolism that processeshydrationandnutrientsat a rate determined by themetabogene. The larger the life form (the more pixels in its body), the more hydration and nutrients it will need each metabolic cycle.Surface areadetermines how much hydration each life form evaporates. The more wrinkled the body is, the more surface area there is.
Simple graph-shaped brains create emergent behavior:fear, agression, attraction...
A simple set of rules, derived from genes, controls the behavior of each animatroid. Animatroids have external sensors (motion/scent/water) and internal sensors (hunger/stress/thirst). Animatroids' brains have attraction/repulsion relationships between these sensors. It is these relationships that determine each animatroid's behavior.
Natural selection and breeding are the only way to evolve your life forms -unless you "cheat" with genetic engineering!
Your animatroids and fungols will evolve over many generations into new species. The genetic code of each life form is passed down to its offspring during reproduction, with a chance of mutation. Evolution is a slow process. To speed things up, try crafting and drinking a lot of sugary beverages. Toxic waste can also be useful (and dangerous!) It can cause drastic mutations in offspring.
Export your creatures and share them with friends!

PAGAN: AUTOGENY


A thousand worlds surround our own, composed of bits and bytes. When they die, where do they go; what secrets do they hide?
Stumble ye, wayfarer, through the wreckage of a deadMMO.

PAGAN: Autogeny is an experimental first person open worldrole playing game set in the digital ruins ofa largely abandoned MMORPG.It is heavily inspired by long-forgotten bargain-bin1990s adventure games, and by a general ethos of user-hostile design. Features include:
> Over 100 acres of lovingly handcrafted playable space
> An increasingly esoteric series of secret endings
> Five major zones + alitany of hidden areas
>Four idiosyncratic repeatableboss fights
> Over 7000 possible gear combinations
> Five strange and eldritch skills
> Very cursed gender_magick()
PAGAN: Autogeny is an exercise in aesthetic maximalism  In other words, it's pretty big,at least by normal altGame standards. A full adventure will take several hours, but you can return to spawn at any point to save and exit. The game also autosaves when passing through doors, in case you have to run off in a hurry.
Good luck, wayfarer, and God Speed.

"I met Anne first, waiting for the bus. I asked her what she was selling and she laughed and said nothing, nothing at all, that what she had to offer was free for anyone who wanted it bad enough. I asked her what had helped her. She just said 'James.'"
Sagebrush is a first-person narrative adventure about exploring the compound of an apocalyptic Millenialist cult in remote New Mexico years after they collectively took their lives in a mass suicide event.
In Sagebrush, you'll investigate the long-abandoned Black Sage Ranch, the former home of Perfect Heaven, an apocalyptic cult formed in the early 1990s under the guiding hand of the prophet Father James.
Inspired by Real-World Apocalyptic Cults
Based on extensive research into cult groups both famous and obscure, large and small, Sagebrush avoids simplistic motivations and easy answers. The members of the Flock are diverse and complex people with varied needs, hopes, and fears.
An Immersive, Lo-Fi 3D World
Sagebrush features an evocative low-poly, low-resolution, less-is-more art style that combines retro aesthetics with modern technology, along with a fully-realized soundscape and an original ambient musical score that immerses you in the remote New Mexico desert.
A Whole Compound to Explore
Black Sage Ranch is yours to wander, from the trailers that housed the cultists, to the halls where they gathered for food and prayer, to the old mines that stretch out below the compound, untouched for nearly a century.
Uncover the Real Story
Find notes, recordings, and belongings that give insight into the people who lived at Black Sage Ranch. What did they believe? Why did they join? Were they happy? And why did they choose to end it all?
Estimated Play Time: 60-120 minutes

<p>Steam key and DRM free version included!
In a universe driven by targets, a faceless corporation employs you to create an evolving ecosystem you can never hope to control...
Intelligent Design: An Evolutionary Sandbox is a god game with fully simulated genetics and evolution. Create species of plants, herbivores and carnivores and try to control the ever evolving ecosystem. Design and create genetically modified organisms, but remember when you start tampering with genetics it is hard to undo your mistakes...
This is a game for people who dont want to be given all the answers. A game for people who like to experiment with a simulation, at their own pace, and watch what happens.


Key Features
Fully modelled genetics and evolutionThe behavior of each organism are determined by their genetics. How tall will a plant grow? How fast can an herbivore run? How often does a carnivore seek prey? These genetics are passed down generation after generation along with random mutations. Evolution is fully simulated, there are no tricks or statistical approximations. You are watching life evolve on your computer.
Science to be Done
What do all those genes actually do? How is the world score calculated? What does world efficiency even mean? Much like a real scientist you will need to investigate, analyse and work with other players to try and answer these questions. To help you along the way the game outputs data in xml files so you can really get your science on.
Genetic Engineering
Create your own genetically modified organisms, but be careful, once a genome has entered your ecosystem it may be hard to undo the damage ... and are you sure you really know what those genes do yet?
Secrets to Discover
Who is employing you to create this ecosystem? Why are they doing it? Why are you doing it? What are those targets for? The answers to these any many other questions are out there, you just need to work together and find them...

<p>Bonbon is a short horror story, about your childhood.
Even if you weren't a small child in the 80s, you've been here before. Just you and your friendly toys.But this new friend... this is something you are not yet able to understand.
Includes Steam key.
Adam Smith, Rock Paper Shotgun:
"a short, smart tale of domestic horror""Bonbons home, and the voice of mummy shouting from indoors, is authentic""the confusion between what is real and what isnt, and what is threatening and what is malign, rings true""a house of horrors that hit far closer to home than most"
Matt Wales, Kotaku:
"it's ambitious, it's often fascinating, and there are elements that linger long after it's over""there's a lot to admire and appreciate here - from the thread of an entirely different story ... to the clarity of vision and the authentic, evocative period atmosphere""there's certainly enough craft and creativity here, and a lingering strangeness to this everyday terror"

Bonbon is a short-form domestic horror narrative (or walking sim, if you like), made in Unreal Engine 4, set in a suburban UK home in the 1980s,in which you navigate childhood events beyond your capacity to understand, and without parental context.
Play time is around 20 to 40 minutes, depending on your play-style. Progression requires the completion of some simple tasks, but it is mostly about exploring the objects and events around you. Play with mouse and keyboard, or a 360-style gamepad.

If you purchase the DRM-free version via itch.io, you will be able to request a Steam key via the link on the download screen.

Recommended system specifications for Windows PC version:
GeForce GTX 950, or equivalent/faster graphics cardQuad-core processor, 2.5GHz or faster8Gb RAM or moreWindows 7 or later

<p>After finding the cursed play 'The King in Yellow', Trixie Glimmer Smith, a slacking student at Bluebell University recounts the terrible events that set her a week behind in her coursework.
This story follows on from the events of Parsnip (free download here)with a host of new characters and an expanded world, although you can still enjoy it without playing Parsnip.
Trixie is around 3-5 hours long, if you want to play all the content.
Check out the free demo below!
Features
Insight:

Throughout the game events may start to take their toll on Trixie's mind. As Trixie gains insight her narration becomes ever more unreliable.Unlike many sanity systems Trixie's insight system is hidden, meaning you never know for sure when you are being affected by it.This system also means additional playthroughs of the game may vary! Can you really trust anything Trixie sees? Can you afford not to?
Multiple Paths:

Trixie can choose to spend her week with the Friendly, albeit slightly scary shopkeeper Heidi, the excitable baker Gregg or the chill milkwoman Bell.At points the three routes may intertwine, givingdifferent perspectives on the same story.The game also has two main potential endings, with additional minor alternate endings.
A Strange World:

Set in a world of anthropomorphic animals, psychic birds and cosmic gods, Trixie explores the rural England inspired Bluefields County and discovers some of the horrors that secretly lurk in it's scenic countryside.
Art Book:

If you spend $6.99 on Trixie you get an Art book with the game! Exciting stuff! It contains all sorts of concept art, bios and fun trivia about the game, the characters and the world.

Content Warnings:
Trixie Glimmer Smith contains a few mild descriptions of violence, horror, some exploration of negative trans feelings and some bad language.</p></li>

Signs of the Sojourner is a narrative deck-building game about connecting and communicating with others. It breaks away from typical card-battlers by instead challenging you to understand different perspectives and navigate social situations.
Your deck is your character, shaped by your experiences and relationships. Different decks will lead to different narrative paths as your cards impact your ability to communicate with various characters. Rather than building the most "powerful" deck, you will have to make decisions about who you want to be in this world and how you relate to others.
Set in a near-future earth-like world, you take over your mother's store after her death, traveling to diverse locations in order to acquire goods for the shop.This is a world where communities are more insulated, where travel is difficult, and where climate change has made life hard, but you'll still encounter optimistic stories, compassionate characters, and delightful surprises.

When an alien entity appears and threatens his family and the stability of the dream world itself, Jimmy sets out on an adventure to save his family and eradicate the threat of the Pulsating Mass.

<p>Overview
It is the year 198X. Big hair is hot, and the war with the Soviets is colder than a refreshing glass of New Coke. RAD RAYGUN must travel the world fighting communist robots, and save the 1980s by shooting his way through the decade in a totally fresh, expanded version of the original XBLIG game.
SUPER RAD RAYGUN pits Rad against a whole new wave of deadly enemies and locations  from the Communist strongholds of the Far East to strategically insignificant islands off the South American coast. But chill out, because Rad has gnarly new weapons, upgrades, and a revamped gameplay engine to help him out.
Ultra sharp 144p resolution graphics and 4 unique shades of monochrome off-green bring Rad Raygun to life, as only 80s mobile technology can.
Super Rad Raygun is a nod to video games and pop culture of the 1980s and pokes fun at the politics of that era. It is a trip down memory lane for retro enthusiasts, while also incorporating modern systems and play mechanics familiar to todays gamer.
About
Super Rad Raygun is a follow-up to the Xbox Live Indie Game, Rad Raygun. Led by Ronald Reagan and Dr. Yokoi (Dr. Y), Rad Raygun must save the 1980s from communist robots! While the original Rad Raygun had only five levels and limited upgrades, Super Rad Raygun includes over twenty levels, 3 modes of play, a new upgrade system, and a limited-energy mechanic.
As a play portable gamings limited battery life, Super Rad has a limited amount of energy to perform certain abilities, such as jumping, shooting, and dashing. When Rad depletes his energy, he must rest for a few seconds.
Throughout the game, Rad collects bits  these are a form a currency used to buy upgrades from Dr. Y. As Rad becomes more and more powerful, he consumes more and more energy, but thankfully Rad can upgrade his battery life (amount of energy) and his agility (time it takes to recover).
DRM-Free!
Thanks to itch.io, we're bringing you Super Rad Raygun DRM-free for the first time ever! This build does not require Steam and does not feature Achievements or Leaderboards.</p></li>

<p>THE GAME
The Fall of Lazarus is a first person exploration game set in a science fiction future. You are a crew member of the USSC Lazarus waking up from cryo sleep without memories and even without name in an apparently abandoned drifting cargo spaceship. But you're not alone, there is also Hybris, the Artificial intelligence who commands the ship.
The Fall of Lazarus is a deeply narrative video game. You will have to solve some puzzles and explore in order to advance in the story. The universe and story will unveil branching along the scenary, objects and documents left behind by the people who lived in the Lazarus at some point.In addition if you search and connect the dots maybe a greater puzzle will be revealed and the darker truth around you will become brighter.
GAMEPLAY
The Fall of Lazarus is a first person exploration game. There is a main story you'll play but you'll have to search and inspect every detail of the scenary looking for clues, notes, letters and objects and piece by piece gather information about what's happening around you.
There are a lot of mysteries aboard the USSC Lazarus and depends on you how many of them you can resolve along your journey. At the end of it maybe you resolve the bigger puzzle around what's going on. Maybe you're right. Maybe you're wrong. You'll need to have in mind every detail in order to unveil the whole story.
You'll have to resolve some puzzles as well, but we wanted to integrate them in the narrative and the scenery. You are in a spaceship and we wanted it to feel like it. The interaction with these puzzles is the same as in the rest of the game trying to not break the immersion in the story.
And you'll also can interact with the terminals and computers around the ship. Some will give you key information, others will help you in your way out. There is a whole operating system full of software and apps filled with information of any kind to explore and take advantage of. You'll have a tool (called Mnem/0z1n3) that will help you gathering and classifying information and breaking through password protected terminals.
SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
MINIMUM:OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64 bits)Processor: i5 4260u 1.4GHzMemory: 4GBGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 560 1GB/AMD Radeon HD 6870 1GB or betterDirectX: Version 10Storage: 5GB
RECOMMENDED:OS: Windows 7/8.1/10 (64 bits)Processor: i5 6600 3.3GHzMemory: 8GBGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970 4GB/AMD Radeon R9 290 4GB or betterDirectX: Version 11Storage: 5GB
FEATURES
- First person exploration game.- A deeply narrative game with a plot full of twists and mysteries.- Puzles you'll have to solve while advancing in the main story.- A variety of beautifully crafted sceneries.
PROLOGUE DEMO
The Fall of Lazarus: The First Passenger is the conclusive prologue and demo of The Fall of Lazarus. In this little adventure set in the year 2180 you will play as Caleb Rogers, a Gen-Ethics (an audit firm focused on controlling the normative and quality of criogenic, clonation and genetic alteration processes) who wakes up in the USSC Lazarus against his will.The First Passenger is a little slice of the final game where we showcase all the playable mechanics of the full game and also works as an example of the narrative we want to play with. You can play a whole level of the USSC Lazarus out of the five levels will include the final game, every one of them highly detailed and full of objects and terminal to interact with while playing the main story. But we wanted you to enjoy this little stand alone experience separately if you want to. This is only the prologue with another protagonist but we highly recommend you to stay tuned and, when the day comes, enjoy the full experience.
REFERENCES
When we have to describe The Fall of Lazarus in a phrase we always say it's like Firewatch (Campo Santo) meets the film Moon (Duncan Jones).
The astonishing off-frame and foreshadowing narrative of Moon is our core narrative reference and the slow paced development of the plot and clever dialogues of Firewatch are really inspiring to us.
Of course we're filled with references such us Gone Home, Mind: Path to Thalamus, The Guest and films like 2001: a space odyssey or Alien. Even Lost series are being really influencing because of how it works the mysteries and characters.
PLATFORMS
We will launch The Fall of Lazarus on PC at first. We obviously want to release it on as much platforms as we can, but right now we have to focus on the PC version. We also like to port the game to VR but we have to wait to see how things work.

SAI is a third person action game exploring Celtic folklore and deforestation. Set in a magical forest, players will discover an environment damaged and destroyed by onslaughts of machines. These metallic creatures wreck their way through the land to get to the core of its magic, the Heart Tree. Though its presence is now but a lost memory, the machines remain, determined to find this all powerful entity. As a Druid, protector of the natural world, you must explore this beautiful realm, harness the power that still lingers here, and uncover its dark past. Stop the machines. Protect the land. Save the forest.


SAI is Studio Mutiny's first game. As an eco-conscious Indie Games Development Studio, we made SAI because we want to make a difference. We want to reawaken the love and respect for nature we are all capable of. Therefore, we will be donating 80% of all revenue to conservation charities.

Some folks see the daily challenges weve made it a habit to overcome and cant stop themselves from trying to help. Surely theres a way. Surely theres something we havent already tried. And sometimes we humor them, because even though their solution isnt for the right problem what if this one works? What this is the one that helps?
What have we got to lose?
A first-person exploration of anxiety, Feline Therapy is my biggest departure yet; lighter on the gender feels, heavier on the ways we face our problems and the ways we escape them. Its my first full-color book, as well as my first collaboration with a professional illustrator. I hope you like it!

A lot of games have tried to capture that childhood sketchbook-look for varying purposes, but few nail the look and feel of those clumsy, often angsty scribbles as well as Imperishable Memories.-IGN
Your sixth grade diary wants to have a word with you. If that thought is as horrifying for you as it is for me, Imperishable Memories will probably be just as scary.-Cliqist
"A striking message of being frank with ourselves when we hurt others."-IndieGames.com
"An hour long tour-de-force in world building with cool characters, inspiring settings, and style to spare."-Video Game Choo Choo



Imperishable Memories is a narrative-driven shoot-em-up game developed in Unity for PC, Mac, and Linux. It combines bullet-hell gameplay with flashy cutscenes and angsty pondering to tell a story about coming to terms with horrible mistakes and gaining the strength to move on, little by little.
With features like Relaxed Difficulty and a Story Mode with infinite lives, you don't have to worry about being a shmup expert to experience the entire game!Roughly one hour to complete the story, with a high score system to challenge your skills afterwards!A strange, experimental adventure with desolate landscapes, sword girls, glitchy moments, live action segments, and more!Over a dozen music tracks, with boss characters getting their own theme songs!Worried about specs? This game was developed on and optimized for Intel HD Graphics machines!

<p>Speed Dating for Ghostsis a weird lil' narrative game about speed dating ghosts by Ben Gelinas (Dragon Age, Mass Effect) and Mikey Hamm (Mikey Maybe, Glig).
As a lonely specter looking for love in the afterlife, you attend a speed dating event and chat up a cemetery's worth of phantoms, wraiths, and poltergeists. At the end of the spooky mixer, choose your favorite! They'll take you out to all the best haunts: old folks' homes, creepy houses with new owners... Maybe solving a murder is your idea of a good time. Or robbing a bank. Ghosts are into all sorts of things
Key Features
With the added expansion, meet and datetwelve ghosts plus a bonus ghost if you're really committedDeep, branching conversations with markedly different outcomes depending on what you choose to sayA full-fledged date with your favorite ghost that plays out like a text adventure after each speed dating sessionA wide range of quirky characters including spirits of vengeance, compassion, despair, and mischiefOriginal music by Mikey Maybe, the musical alterego of game artist Mikey Hamm

<p>
A Normal Lost Phone is a game about exploring the intimacy of an unknown person whose phone was found by the player.


OUT NOW on PC, MAC, LINUX, iOS and Android!

	Through the interface of a mobile phone, the player must discover what happened to its owner, Sam. Digging through secrets scattered among apps, text messages and photo galleries, the player-voyeur starts witnessing the emotions of Sam, and behind the apparent light-heartedness of a teenage story, their questioning on coming of age, homophobia, depression or the search of oneself.




Features 


An immersive and intuitive way of introducing the narrative through a fake smartphone interface. 
A game that bridges the gap between reality and fiction by letting players act as themselves. The game asks a simple question: if you close the app but still think about the game, have you truly stopped playing? 
A relatable story that helps build empathy with the characters, allowing to explore difficult topics such as identity, gender binarism, individuation and privacy.





	"It shares some of the feeling of Her Story, albeit featuring today's technology and with less of a focus on the crime angle. But it has the same small moments of revelation, all of which come together to form a story in its own neat yet meandering way." 
Rock Paper Shotgun 

	"This new phone has a lot to explore, even if you may not see it on the first look. It's a clever way of delivering a narrative, with you discovering more about Sam, the more you investigate the phone. Will you find out what happened to Sam?"

Peace. Kids playing in mech wreckage. A ghost.
One last journey across an ancient battleground to find a pilot's final resting place.
A GM-less storytelling and map-drawing game for 3 or more players.*About how we remember war, how we forget, and all that remains when the echoes fade.1-3 hours to play (usually 2+ hours if more than 4 players).4 pages (excluding cover and hex map).3 random tables for creating an advanced or low-tech landscape littered with destroyed mechs from the last great war.An optional blank hex map is also available to download and print.You will need to bring your own pencils or crayons for drawing the map, and a 6-sided die would be useful, but not necessary.
* 1-on-1 play is also possible. See ECH0_1-on-1.txt.

This game was inspired by the wreckage of a downed Japanese Zero fighter Icame across in the Sabah countryside when I was a kid. The stripped fuselage had been lying there for nearly 40 years. A lonely,fallen engine of destruction.
Once, a pilot depended upon the machine for his life. I wonder what conversation I might have had with his ghost. I wonder if the wreck is still there.


As heard on Friends at the Table: The Road to PARTIZAN!


Watch ECH0 being played on Gauntlet Hangouts featuring Rachelle Dube, creator of Dino Wranglers.

"Ech0 by Kai Pohstole my heart and I will always shout my love for it from the rooftops. It's gmless, pick up and play, and short though provides a really beautiful story that I'm still thinking about. It's just a great game." - Rachelle Dube

"A very whimsical RPG. If you ever need to add character, humanity or background material to a more serious Mecha RPG, this would be it. But it's also nice as a standalone."- zenai2020

"love looking back at maps made from previous sessions of this game and remembering those stories! i particularly enjoy the chance to see a world through lenses of the now (the children) and the past (the pilot)."-  justinquirit

"I really like Ech0! Got that Tales From The Loop feel down pat. Very countryside childhood exploration."- Ben Chong | Swords and Flowers
"Ce jeu est un jeu profond au sens qu'il propose de convoquer  la table d'intenses motions." -fery31251826
"Today I picked up ECHO by @tunkaipoh. A haunting game about children who find the ghost of a mecha pilot among piles of wreckage. The presentation of this game is so lovely highly recommend!" -Hannah Shaffer

<p>The Ground Itself is a one-session storytelling  game for 2-5 players, played with highly accessible materials (a coin, a six-sided die, and a deck of cards).
Focusing on place- one specific place, chosen by the group - The Ground Itselfunfolds over radically disparate time periods that may range from 4 days to 18,000 years. By casting wildly into time, it considers how places both change and remember themselves. Fundamentally, The Ground Itself is about  the echoes and traces we leave for others after we are gone.

<p>A critical companion to one of the most popular videogame series ever made.
Violent. Funny. Weird. Sexy. Political. Historical. Gothic. Incomprehensible. Brilliant. Awful. Original. Lazy. The very best of games. The very worst of games. Metal Gear Solid is all of these things and more. For twenty years, it has incited as much as it has entertainedthrilled and inflamed in equal measure. It begs analysis while at the same time defying simple definitions. To make any sense of Metal Gear Solid would surely take an entire book.
Hence Okay, Hero. By looking at how its identity has gradually changed, and the social and pop cultural events that have influenced it, we, the Bullet Points editorial team of Reid McCarter, Ed Smith, and Astrid Rose attempt in Okay, Hero to pin down precisely what makes Metal Gear Solid Metal Gear Solid; to identify the inspirations behind its bizarre sci-fi design, untangle its fraught relationships with sex and gender, and hone in on its ideas about the modern world.
Featuring a cover illustration by Sishir Bommakanti and interior design by Dan Solberg, Okay, Hero, includes an introduction and 12 chapters-two each on Metal Gear Solid, Sons of Liberty, Snake Eater, Guns of the Patriots, Peace Walker, and The Phantom Pain written by Ed Smith and Reid McCarter and edited by Ed, Reid, and Astrid Rose.

Note 1:When you import the tiles, you'll notice the edges hang off outside the yellow border on the import settings window;this is intentional. If you try to resize the tiles to be inside the yellow line it will mess up the way the black borders overlap.Install the regular tiles and flatty-uppy tiles as separate tilesets!

Four Horsemen is a visual novel / SLG about homelands and the immigrant experience. Play as a group of four contemporary immigrant teenagers squatting in a World War II era machine gun bunker, trying to find a place for themselves in a pre-apocalyptic, present-dystopian country that has no place for them. Will you go native, turning against your own people to bury the past your parents fled to escape? Will you cling to your parents' identity at any cost, at the price of being a permanent stranger in your home country? Or will you strike out on your own, turning against both your homelands to shape a destiny for yourself? Love is all you need...and also improvised firearms.
Drawing from the developers' own lived experiences, interviews with current and former immigrant teens from around the world, and a year of painstaking anthropological research, featuring 4 different main storylines, 9 different endings, 12 different playable homelands (all of which play differently), and a multitude of agonizing, important decisions, Four Horsemen is the most heartwarmingly familiar, brutally honest video game about the immigrant experience ever created. One playthrough can be finished in a matter of hours, but you'll want to revisit it again and again to see all of the many stories the game has to tell...and to pursue that elusive dream of a land you can call your own.
Exciting Bullet Points!!
YOUR DECISIONS MATTER. Hard choices you make at the beginning come back to haunt you at the end. Characters turn out to be heroic or villainous depending on how you treat them--and they don't always reward you for treating them well.NO TWO COUNTRIES PLAY ALIKE. Each homeland has its own unique vocabulary, set of cultural values, prejudices, and history. Choices that are a good idea in one country turn out to be a reaaaaally bad idea in another. Like a real immigrant, you'll have to read your new culture and learn to adapt.NOT JUST BLACK AND WHITE. No faction reputation system! No alignment meter! Four Horsemen offers realistic, genuinely difficult moral choices, and to some questions there are no right answers--only different consequences.DELIGHTFUL CRAFTING SYSTEM. Make that cold, austere war bunker feel like home--dive into dumpsters scrounging for parts, or buy them with your earnings from your terrible day job, and make reasonable DIY facsimiles of things you can't afford! Characters interact with things you build. Make a disco ball and they'll throw a dance party, patch up that hole in the roof and they'll enjoy a quiet moment together on a rainy day. But beware--the system is not exactly fair to immigrants...TRIUMPH OVER HATE. A bigot pulls a knife on you--what do you do? Do you try to de-escalate the situation with words...or respond by drawing your own blade? Our combat system replicates the anxiety and tension of real violence, not a power fantasy.THE MOST ADVANCED PROFANITY SYSTEM IN A VIDEO GAME, EVER. Audited by real current and former teenaged native speakers! Learn how to cast aspersions on a person's ancestry in 10 different real-world languages!</p></li>

<p>Rym 9000 is a hyperkinetic shooter inspired by Akira, Neon Genesis Evangelion, and Guxt.A treasure-hunting journey to the Moon developed by Sonoshee and composed by Roex.A unique high-octane experience conceived to stimulate your senses and make your eyes and ears bleed!








Rym 9000 is a vertical shmup in which you fight your way through 5 levels of concentrated action to reach the Moon and find the Rym 9000 treasure; a legendary relic left by an ancient civilization, buried in the Moon for a generation of pilots to find and "turn the world upside down."




With an emphasis on haywire motion and experimental visuals from Sonoshee, along with a cyber-stellar soundtrack from Roex, Rym 9000 will take you on a chaotic trip of challenging but fair hyperkinetic fun.




Achievements are set in place for the player to unlock World Log entries and know more about the world they're venturing into, as well as understanding the history behind the treasure that the protagonist and millions of other pilots are setting out to find.




Fight your way through relentless hordes of enemies, defeat each area's boss all the way up to the Moon's guardian "Diesel", and register your score upon beating the game on a leaderboard that records the top 10 players in the world.





	Rym 9000 features a soundtrack from Roex.
His albums can be found on Bandcamp and Soundcloud:

Memlog Hunter.10/thmw1: Lost in space. Surrounded. Strange structures that build themselves  hive-like. And at their core, alien starcells... Must get home. Back to Hunters Moon. Must... survive! Am attacking now  full thrust  cannons locked in  FIRE! Little do you know what you face: over 180 levels of galactic mayhem. Hope you are a CLEVER psychoblaster  or else...'


Originally released in 1987, Hunter's Moon is a strategic shoot 'em up set in deep space. Beautifully presented and thoughtfully designed, the game became an instant classic thanks to its measured balance of strategic planning and psychotic blasting. Boasting one of the earliest uses of procedurally-generated content in a computer game, Hunter's Moon pushed the boundaries of the genre and helped redefine what a shoot 'em up could be.
Hunters Moon Remastered is a fully remastered, overhauled, and updated version of the seminal C64 shoot em up. The game has been remastered for C64 cartridge and boasts a host of amazing new features including over 50 new levels, 5 new star systems, new level types, new music, new playing modes, stunning intro and outro sequences, built-in level editor, and enhanced presentation including foreign language support.


After flying your trusty ship Hunter too close to a black hole, you find yourself lost in space on the wrong side of the galaxy, surrounded by sprawling, hive-like cities. At the core of each city lie mysterious alien Starcells  these contain valuable navigational data and must be collected to plot a course back home.
The aim of each level is to blast through the hive and grab the Starcells, a task made more challenging by the invincible Worker cells which patrol the cities repairing any damage inflicted. These Workers also bring the hive's defenses to life, causing them to spew deadly spores that can only be resisted by using your ship's trusty Perma-Shields.
The game features over 180 levels spread across 21 star systems. When all the Starcells on a level have been collected you'll enter the Bonus Game where you can earn a Perma-Shield and an extra life. You must complete every level within each star system to advance to the next; however, should you manage to collect four flashing Starcells you'll automatically jump to the next system.
As you progress through the different star systems you'll encounter an array of diverse and challenging hive types, including Attackers that throw out deadly spores, Darkcells which are only visible on radar, Switchers that change direction without warning, Jumpgates which jump to random locations, and Blackouts which plunge the hives into darkness.
Do you have the dexterity, precision timing and psychopathic blasting skills to find your way home to Hunter's Moon...?


Over 180 levels spread across 21 Star Systems
  New level types including Jumpgates and Blackouts
Trainer Version designed for novice players
  All-new Random Mode to test seasoned veterans
  Automatically save your game progress as you playStunning new intro and outro sequences

The downloadable C64 digital version is designed for use with a C64 emulator  it cannot be used with an EasyFlash cartridge, 1541 Ultimate, or Turbo Chameleon. We recommend playing the game using VICE 3.1+, a popular emulator compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux.
  
Therefore, there are two downloadable versions, one containing the game files, the other containing the game files plus a version of the VICE emulator. Both versions include a simple .BAT file to make running the game much simpler. Please be sure to consult the README file for more information.
Bonus: The downloads section now includes a special version of the game created especiallyfor the C64 Mini, along with a "CJM"configuration file. Note that game saving is disabled in the C64 Mini version, both during the game and within the level editor - it is therefore necessary to use the C64 Mini's built-in save functionality to save your game and your level designs. Again, please consult the README file for more information.


The cartridge version of Hunter's Moon Remastered is now available exclusively from Protovision. The basic includes a cartridge, game manual, cover art postcard, and Thalamus sticker.

	Super Hexagon is a minimal action game by Terry Cavanagh, with music by Chipzel.
Important facts about Hexagons:
Hexagons are first order permutohedrons: The vertices of a hexagon can be formed by permuting the coordinates of the vector (1, 2, 3). 
The north pole of the planet Saturn has a hexagonal storm cloud pattern with 8,600 mile long sides, larger than the diameter of Earth. 
Though hexagon may appear to be a difficult word to rhyme, there are actually dozens of words that rhyme with it. For example: Autobahn, decagon, decathlon, electron, Kyrgzstan, Lebanon, leprechaun and marathon.

FAQ
Which devices are known to work with DrumBrain?
- Rockband 1 wired drumset- Rockband 2 wireless drumset- Rockband 3 wireless drumset- Rockband cymbals extension- Guitar Hero World Tour drumset- ION DrumBrocker- Mad Catz portable Rockband drums- XBOX 360 and One gamepads- Various Rockband and Guitar Hero guitarsRockband 4, and PS4 drumkits NOT currently supported. But if you can get it to work with Windows, and recognised as a Game Controller, then DrumBrain will use it.
Will you help me connect a device?
No, sorry. I cannot provide support for anything besides the software 
itself. Before you purchase DrumBrain, you have a device that is 
working, and recognized as a Game Controller (click here for details)
Will it work with [hardware/controller]?
If it's not listed above, it's not guaranteed to work. Before you 
purchase, make sure it connects to your PC and is recognized as a Game 
Controller (click here for details).
Will PS3 controllers work?
PS3 controllers may require additional 3rd party software
 (install at your own risk). I do not offer support for getting 
controllers setup on your computer. Please ensure it works before purchasing.
TROUBLESHOOTING
I get an error message "The code execution cannot proceed because MSVCR110.dll was not found..." when I run DrumBrain.exe
The MicrosoftVisual C++Redistributable installer (vc_redist_x86.exe comes in the DrumBrain zip file), is required to install before attempting to run DrumBrain.
I get an error message "OpenGL functions unsupported..." when I run DrumBrain.exe. What does this mean?
Update your video card drivers. If you've never done it, here's how.Why do you need to do this? OpenGL drivers used to be provided with windows, but no longer. You must acquire them by updating your graphics adapter drivers. DrumBrain will work after you've done this, and you will also benefit from having up-to-date drivers.
When I hit a pad, there's an audible delay/latency. Can I do anything to improve this?
Maybe. Ensure you are using a WASAPI audio device. Go into Settings -> Audio, and test the devices under WASAPI tab. Use one that works.If you're already using a WASAPI device, then your PC may be outdated. DrumBrain doesn't look it, but it's a high performance real time audio application, and benefits greatly from a fast computer.</p></li>

<p>What was I trying to make here?
Boa Retinais a game that dives deep into messy gender uncertainty. It is an uncomfortable blend of abstract golden-age arcade design, retro computer aesthetic, the unhealthy ways my gender feelings manifested before coming out, and external conflicts from things trying to keep life in order. It is a story of breaking free

<p>Seven years ago, five heroes were brought together to save the world. Their success came at the cost of their leader's life; the secret behind it cost them their friendship.
Now they've been summoned for a new heroic quest. 
if not us is about the moment when they realise everything isn't going to be okay.
The demo above includes two of the five vignettes.
Included on the Nebula Awards Suggested Reading List 2018
if not us is splendid; wonderful...it's five eulogies and five broken hearts, and again, and again. I cannot recommend it enough.-@demanrisu
if not us is a must-play for anyone who tells people's stories. It's sort of about what happens after destiny is done with you, and it plays with format phenomenally, and I love it. -Nissa Campbell
A collection of heartbreaking vignettes...obscure at times, but deliberately and productively so. -Cat Manning

Five short stories from five alternate timelines, each from the perspective of a different character and with new insight into the overarching narrative.
Each story has its own style of interaction: watch your life flash before your eyes, write a letter to your loved ones, plead your case, or just stand still and think for a while.
Some of our heroes may yet turn away from their deadly fates, some may succumb, and some may need convincing.
Nearly 30,000 words of branching narratives.
The stories in the anthology can be played in (nearly) any order, but you might find yourself revisiting one or two later with new insight.
I hope you like dramatic irony.
And big women with horns.

Kotaku AU:PSA: There's Another Carly Rae Jepsen RPG(by Alex Walker) - 8/7/2019"First there was the sci-fi heist to break out all of Carly Rae Jepsen's unreleased songs, and now there's a cultist RPG. Where all your mutations are based off Carly Rae Jepsen lyrics.It's called Black Heart, and it's a one-shot RPG from the maker of that Carly Rae Jepsen RPG called Boy Problems. It's the second one-shot tabletop RPG in a trilogy that's themed after the Canadian pop star, but instead of being about her music, it's ... much darker."
Bell of Lost Souls:Theres Not One But TWO Carly Rae Jepsen RPGs And They Are Weird And Wonderful(by J.R. Zambrano)- 17/7/2019"This is an incredible premise, and more importantly, it shows what depths RPGs can explore. These are all created from Carly Rae Jepsens music, and each takes on a wildly different genre, theme, even play style. All of this highlights both the transcendant nature of CRJs musics, and the deeper truths they speak upon, while also showing us the beauty of RPGs. Theyre about playing pretend and you can make them about anything. And people do.Thats the same spirit of inventiveness and creativity that kicked off this game. And when you look around at all the big releases, for instance, Gen Con this year is chock full of licensed IP games from big publishers and sequels to smash hit games. These are safe choices that deliver an experience that, while enjoyable, is the same basic experience we have been having since 1974. We need games like the Jepsen Triptych to capture that weird, experimental feeling that drives humanity ever onward."
Destructoid:In your Black Heart is where you'll find the newest Carly Rae Jepsen TTRPG(by Wes Tacos)- 19/7/2019"I know it's a tough world out there, but at least we have this. Hold onto it folks; keep it sacred."

Jay Is Games - "...as a puzzle game and a solo-venture at that, there is an incredible and impressive amount of love and polish in every moment. I was surprised, repeatedly, by several clever twists and turns...I could easily and gladly exist in The Search's liminality for hours longer, in its lovingly designed and beautifully rendered levels, its gorgeous, thoughtful soundtrack, and curious, otherworldly atmosphere."
Doctor's of Gaming - "The game is short, about an hour or two. But it was enough to impress me. It knows what it is, and executes that well. Pleasing visuals, good music/sound, an intriguing setting/story and fresh puzzles round out this surprising little gem."
GameRaven - Big experiences can sometimes come in small packages and the time

How does Reissue differ from the original Memoir En Code released in 2015? 
The game features all new graphics, interface, and parts of it have been re-designed. Reissue also includes a new final track to give closure to the game, plus the dev commentary. Take it as a sort of HD Remaster Extended Director's Cut edition.


Should I buy this game?
If you like experimental games, yes.
	If you don't like experimental games, maybe.
	
	If you give more value to content than length, yes.
	
	If you give more value to length than content, no.


Can I put a Let's Play video on YouTube?
Yes BUT, considering that the game is fairly short, I'd appreciate if you could at least avoid recording the new (last) track called Lei Disse as well as the solution of Memoir De Code.

"It seemed like the start of something new. Something that would change."You are a senior in high school along with your two best friends, Naomi Patterson and Suzu Cappini. You are also the granddaughter of Harold Anderson, the CEO and founder of Anderson Toys, a toy company sworn to give children amazing products and give a large part of their profit to charity.One day, you get called home to attend your grandfather's funeral. After the funeral, you learn that you have inherited his large estate. Your father suggests you move in immediately, so the next day, you move out of your parents home and into your estate.When you enter your new home, however, you see five injured, yet very handsome men on the lobby floor. They eventually awaken and make it known that they were attacked by a group of dangerous 'misfits' and ran to find shelter, passing out as soon as they entered your home.You find out that they are incubi, 'demons who consume and use sexual energy of humans to survive'. With nowhere to go and a target on their backs, they ponder what what to do. Out of sympathy, you offer your home as refuge for a while in exchange for minor servitude (it is a big house, after all). They happily agree.What will happen as the incubi get comfy? Why exactly did they come the human world? Who are the 'misfits', and will they stop pursuing them so the incubi can leave?...Will you WANT them to leave?</p></li>

<p>Mable & The Wood is a Metroidvania where you can take the form of the bosses that you kill, changing how you're able to explore the interconnected world. It's also a Metroidvania where you don't have to kill anyone.
The strange cult that resurrected you speak of an ancient prophecy that says you will hunt down the great beasts, take their shape, and use their powers to save this dying world. But what if they're wrong? The prophecy is old, and words lose their meaning with time...
When the world is falling apart around you, what will you do? In Mable & The Wood, it's up to you to make that choice. You don't have to kill anyone, but you might kill everyone.
Will you banish the darkness, or will you become it?
COMBAT IS MOVEMENT

The way you move is deadly. Dragging a sword that is too heavy to lift, Mable shape-shifts into a fairy and leaves it where she stood. Recall the sword to your hand once again to slice through any enemies in your path.
You can only maintain your non-human form for a limited time, but killing creatures extends your power.
HUNT THE GREAT BEASTS AND TAKE THEIR SHAPE

Defeat the great beasts to take their shape and transform into a mole, medusa, spider and more...
Find and defeat the other bosses to unlock even more shapes!
EXPLORE A DYING WORLD

The game takes place in a dark fantasy world, with each area making up part of a large, complex map that's packed full of all kinds of secrets for you to discover.
Uncover secrets that you can use to find alternative, non-combat routes through the world and discover a different side to the story (and multiple endings!)
DISCOVER WHO YOU REALLY ARE

Discover a rich story and define your own role in it. Will you become the saviour everyone's trying to convince you to be, or will your actions lead to the world literally tearing itself apart?
FEATURES
Your choices matter - The cult wants you to kill everything, but it's up to you whether or not you listen to them or find your own path and unlock the multiple endings
A rich story with a diverse cast of characters who have their own take on this whole 'end of the world' thingCombat is movement and movement is combat - Mable can't lift her magical sword, so she has to use it in unique ways to move through the worldA large and varied fantasy world brought to life with state-of-the-art pixel technology and a beautiful original soundtrackMultiple endings, different routes to take through the world and secrets to discover

<p>"Starseed Pilgrim is a game about tending a symphonic garden, exploring space, and embracing fate."

			You are a gardener, tending to empty noise and empty space to fill 
them both with colour. You are a refugee, building your own world away 
from the spreading darkness. You are an explorer, discovering new 
places, new rules, and new fascinations. The universe is bigger than you
 know.~I really don't like describing Starseed Pilgrim! But if I don't, I'm pretty much asking you to buy it based on... images, and that's worse. It's a game about discovery and learning, and eventually about mastery of a strange set of tools. It's been said, and echoed, that it's a game you have to experience for yourself.I guess I believe that. :)</p></li>

<p>Story:Peace is scarce in the country of Aslande, and it has been at war with the neighbouring country of Eressia for centuries. When one battle ends, another inevitably begins, either months or years later. To Rhea, however, war is a distant concept; something she has heard about, but never witnessed. Born in a small, secluded village, Rhea occupies her life with more mundane concerns: her job at the local hospital, her playful bickering with her friend Asa, and her prayers for a successful harvest come autumn.
However, when Rhea's childhood friend, Luca, returns home to the village after fighting in one of Aslande's many wars, Rhea is suddenly faced with a problem. Why is Luca suddenly so cold, so distant? What did he see out on the battlefield, and how did it change him?
At the same time, new worries plague Rhea, as one of the patients at the hospital is suffering from a rather perplexing illness - and a failure to cure him could have some unpleasant outcomes...About:This World Unknown is a fantasy-themed otome game where the player assumes the role of the first person narrator, Rhea, and can romance four available guys. Which route you end up on depends on the choices made during the common route.The character routes themselves are rather long, and have a lot of plot twists and world building (and lots and lots of characters).The screen resolution is 1280x720.

<li><a href="https://grimogre.itch.io/michtim">https://grimogre.itch.io/michtim</a>
<p>Michtim is my love letter to Saturday morning cartoons like Ewoks and the Smurfs. It's also an idealistic game, because in this game, it's not about the monsters you slay  quite contrary. It's about exploring a world that's larger and hostile, but that holds wonder and amazement. Michtims want to protect nature;and they want to set humans back on the path to a better life. It can be a heartwarming experience;but it also has tight mechanics and can handle fights.
The game features a totally unique System. Your traits are Emotions, and on rolls that come up as 6, you generate Mood markers of the appropriate emotion. Your character can also have a combination of 12 Callings. These are very minimalistic and simple on one hand, but you can combine them however you like and the best thing:you can play an Angry, a Compassionate or a Scaredy-Cat Cook. There are no favored Stats in this game, so each Class can be played in 5 very radically different ways!
This game means a lot to me, since it marks my graduation into a full fledged Master of Arts;but it's also the baby of my disabled partner Alex and myself. We always lacked a space that was welcoming to us;and with Michtim, we basically wanted to offer peeps a place that's free from oppression.
I really hope you enjoy the game, and as a special offer for you itch-friendlies, Ihave added all the previously add-on DIY card printing files for FREE.
If you want to buy physical copies, you can get them on my DriveThruRPG.

<p>From the creator of PonyIsland...

In a creaky old tavern, in a forgotten corner of the video game universe, a storm is raging. The barkeep gets a patchy phone call. It's hard to tell what the caller is saying, but this much is clear: someone in The Six Pint Innis planning a murder.
There are six patrons; all of them are video gameprotagonists trying to escape their past... But The Six Pint Inn has a way of bringing back oldmemories. Each flashback plays out in an entirely different genre, sometimes blending multiple. By exploring these memories you may discover the identity of the murderer... or you may learn much darker secrets.


In The Hex you will...
Control the six patrons and explore The Six Pint InnDelve into the memories of these cast-aside game protagonists to learn the truth of their pastLearn the identity of the would-be murderer... as well as the victim
The Hex takes roughly 6 hours to complete on the first playthrough.

A game that defies me to tell you anything about it, not that Im convinced youd believe me if I did.

<p>You don't know who you are, or how you got here. There's no explanation for any of this.There's only one thing you can do. Endure the challenges that get thrown in your way, learn them as best as you can and find a way to escape from this eternal punishment.Fight. Not to save the world, but to maybe save yourself.
An endless stream of challenges
Splinter Zone creates an infinite chain of levels for you to traverse and test your skills in.

Splinter Zone is a challenging game, but sometimes you may want to have a more relaxed experience. For those moments, Splinter Zone features a handy array of cheats that you can enable right at the start of the game. You can even turn off all enemies in the game, if you so desire...

Lose yourself in the lovingly hand-painted alien world of Viridis Primus. Ensure the success of the colony as you make friends and pursue romance with a diverse cast of characters.

<p>
Witchball is a post-reality racing game played by children in the year 2601.
Massive environmental change has made much of the world inaccessible, and long-distance travel impossible. Communities are isolated, but communication has advanced to the point where short distances between people barely exist at all.
In Witchball, two players compete in a high speed foot-race while simultaneously playing a 2D pong-like ball game on the surface of the screen. Points are gained in both aspects and tallied per lap, so its important -- and tricky -- to manage the space better than the opponent.

Originally used for fishing, glass buoys became associated with witches during witch-hunts in the late 1600s. Traditionally, a witch ball is a glass orb hung in a home to ward away bad or evil spirits. The act of play, and games by extension, can function in a similar way -- kind of like a respite from the darkness. Games wont solve any problems, and neither will a ward, but safeguards and rest are necessary parts of life and games can provide that. A game as a ward, not an escape.

<p>A creativity-driven RPG about a rundown theatre and pleasing its unruly clientele.
Nobody said that opening a theatre on the wrong side of the river was going to be easy! The roof may be leaking, and the audience may be armed to the teeth, but nothing is going to stop the Rainsdowne Players from becoming the premier (and only!) theatre troupe in town!
Features:
Correctly handle 'friendly encouragement' from your audience, in the form of thrown bottles, tomatoes and even the occasional fish.Collect inspiration cards from the audience, and combine them to concoct new plays to please the pickier customers.Hang out with a homeless cat who likes board games.Convince the ticket desk clerk not to leave her dead end job.Survive a boss battle in the form of several hundred disinterested schoolchildren.Plays like if Paper Mario and Majora's Mask had a child, but the father was secretly Rhythm Tengoku.
The Rainsdowne Players is an RPG about winning hearts and minds. Explore the town of Rainsdowne and get to know the peculiar inhabitants, all of whom may have a particular play they want to see, even if they don't realise it yet! Gather inspiration in the form of cards and use it to build the narrative of your next show, but it's never quite that simple and whether dodging projectiles or surviving a sword fight, you've got to actually make it through the performance in one piece!
A note from the Rainsdowne Tourist Board:
Due to a faulty and irreversible weather charm several hundred years ago, the town of Rainsdowne does get an awful lot of rain, but don't let that dampen your spirits! There's lots to see and do around town:
Try and sink some questionably depicted pirates at the cannon range.Take part in our lively card battling scene. There's always a tournament running.Enjoy some surprisingly relaxing fishing by the docks.Enjoy some surprisingly non-relaxing yoga in the park.Take to the stage at the Royal Flush bar, which was definitely not a public washroom only a few weeks ago.

Also available onNintendo Switch!</p></li>

Knit bones, stitch muscles, and weave neurons into biologically-realistic underwater lifeforms.
It's like Spore, but with actual science.

Liked the cell stage of Spore, but wanted more depth? Gotten merrily lost in the graphical programming puzzles of SpaceChem? Love the "can I manage to build this...?" creativity of Kerbal Space Program?
Crescent Loom is the very first biologically-realistic nervous system simulation game. It lets you  in a hands-on, mad-scientist way  tinker with everything from neurotransmitter to the ecological niche of an animal.
So dive in and maybe  just maybe  by poking around with these simple creatures you'll figure something out about how your own body ticks.
[ More Info | Play Online Free ]


Crescent Loom is currently in open development; expect potentially major bugs, crashes, changes, and additions as I work on it over the next few years.
The best way to keep an eye on this is by subscribing to my monthly wickletter.The "play online free" link above brings you to the HTML5 version that runs in-browser. Paying for Crescent Loom gives you access to the version that runs natively on PC/Mac/Linux. The only differences are the technical constraints; HTML5 has no saving/loading locally, runs slower, and is locked to a 1024x768 resolution.</p></li>

<p>Lingotopia is a language learning game about being lost in a city where you don't speak the language. Learn Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish and more! You play a little girl shipwrecked on the shores of a strange island. In order to get back home you'll need to explore the island and talk to its inhabitants. Sadly, no one speaks your language! You'll have to learn words one at a time to decipher what these strange creatures are saying.
How does it work?
Explore a lovingly handcrafted city.Click on objects in the environment and your guide will teach you the word for them.Learn words by talking to the city's inhabitants.Voice recordings by native speakers teach you the correct pronunciation.Learning a language with a different script? Toggle between the romanised and native script at any time.
Words you know can be translated when they appear during conversations. So, the more words you know, the more you'll begin to feel at home in this strange place. You might even be able to find a way off the island!

Will this really help me learn a language
Yes! Learning words is the most important part of language learning. You can learn several hundred words by playing Lingotopia. As the game only translates individual words and not entire sentences, you also learn word order and grammar by playing. All dialogue in the game is tied to the setting and story, so you have a reason to decipher each and every sentence.

What languages can I learn?
The official languages are Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese, Russian, Spanish. You can learn English in each of these languages. There are also over 20 "unofficial languages", these don't have voice recordings and I won't be able to vouch for the accuracy of the translations. I will keep an up to date list of the included unofficial languages athttps://www.lingoludo.com/lingotopia/.

These same easy methods for us to make changes and add new content are also available to you. Currently, Monster and Item data as well as graphics are located in a folder called "

Clam Man
is the story of the Clam Man. Intriguing, isn't it? Yes, it's true - he is a clam and yet also a man. This is not a topic of debate, it is fact. We've confirmed it while working on this game. Using science."He certainly is a clam man." - PlaytesterThank You, Playtester - we couldn't agree more.

But to be more specific: This is the story of a man, recently promoted to junior sales representative, enjoying the comforts and leisure of lower-mid-level office work. However, things suddenly take a turn for the worse, and the Clam Man is cast into an adventure full of danger, suspicion, and mystery. Join him, as he unravels the conspiracy behind the tragic event that befalls him, and fight to restore CLAMMY JUSTICE to the world of Snacky Bay.
FEATURES
A story full of twists and turns and a huge amount of strange jokes!More than 20 unique and strange characters to interact with! (I really like the jellyfish personally)A spectacular original soundtrack!Lots of plantsUmmPhone calls!Puzzles!Knots!The most evil bad guy in the history of evil bad guysAnime fight scene!Our boys in blue!And of course, a duck.

WHOAH WHOAH WHOAH ENOUGH WITH THE JOKES What is all this about even
Clam Man is a point'n'click adventure game, with an emphasis on story rather than puzzles. We wanted to create a game focused on the parts we loved about old school adventure games - the story and the jokes. It's a simple, entertaining game where you explore the world and interact with it's inhabitants. Oh, and we did throw a few puzzles in here and there, too.
IS THE CLAM MANFOR ME?I don't know you, but I'm sure you're a pretty cool person. I'll just ask a couple questions to figure that out:
Do you enjoy story-driven games?Do you enjoy absurd and strange comedy?Do you want to relax and play a game where the primary objective is to make you laugh at said strange comedy?Have you got a thing for ridiculous underwater settings and weird, nonsensical stories?
well yeah you know in that case it's definitely for youMuch love,//Team Clam</p></li>

<p>Somewhere in the Old West, there lies a cabin full of corpses.
If you had arrived moments sooner, you might have been one of them.
It all started on Christmas Day, when The Old Sheriff of New Town was murdered. In the days that followed, several dangerous strangers would make their way to the Mount Inn, an isolated shelter on the mountain path between New Town and Old Town, and kill each other.

Now its down to you to untangle their motives and piece together the bigger picture from the gruesome aftermath.

You were exiled from the City. Whatever you once were, whatever life you lived before, it has been cut off from you as the gates slam shut behind you. Right now, you are but one of the lost in these catacombs, desperately searching for that one, flickering light of hope:Somewhere down here in the dark, they say there is a way out. You are not the first nor the last to be exiled, and you are not alone down here. You can work together with your fellow exiles, or you can conspire against them, but know this - it is a long, hard road to walk alone.A dungeon-crawling game for for 3-6 players, in which those exiled for their crimes must make it through a dark and buried labyrinth to the fabled Exile's Gate, beyond which freedom lies.

The Dark Below was written for the End Jam, hosted by Dylan Grinder. You are encouraged to use safety tools when playing it. You can find the Safety Tools Toolkit here, courtesy of KiennaS and Lauren.Shades and Echoes is a supplement intended for Guides (the equivalent to Game Masters), and explands a little on the advice given in the basic version of the game, as well as giving a list of possible locations, threats and residents of the Dark to include in your game.

<p>Build your fleet, trade, explore and conquer
Helium Rain is a single-player space simulation that places you at the helm of a spacefaring company. Trade resources, buy ships and stations to fulfill contracts ! Dock at stations to buy and sell you wares or upgrade your ship, upgrade your technology to be more efficient and militarize your fleet to prevent piracy.
You will need to master both real-time action and long-term strategy: destroying a freighter has a direct impact on the economy, while declaring war will make your spaceflight environment slightly more hostile...

13 playable ships with weapon and engine upgradesBuild and fly fleets of fighters, bombers, cargos, corvettes or capital ships. Buy new engines and weapons.Fast-paced combat with Newtonian flight, localized damage and joystick supportThere is no speed limit in Helium Rain. You can fly at half a mile a second while aiming backwards. Aim for critical systems in order to disable ships, kill their crew or capture targets, and don't fly into asteroids.Complex economy modelTake advantage of a complex simulation of space trade to be the most competitive company.A planetary system to exploreExplore around 25 sectors orbiting the gas giant Nema and its moons.Procedural contracts, world exploration, technology upgradesPick contracts and build your empire to become the largest company.Quick-action skirmish modeSetup your fleet, pick an opponent and go into fighting action right away !

A world that feels real
Your ships have generators, radiators, weapons, engines, cargo bays or life support systems - they all work together. Every thruster on your ship plays a role. Aim for engines to pin down your enemies, or send them spinning around by destroying power stations. Most ships have more than thirty individual parts ! You can customize the most important parts of your ships - your main engines, attitude control thrusters, weapons and hull colors.
Your competitors are independent factions, companies with the same goal as yours - ruling the system. They will try to undercut you, or even attack you if you become a threat to them. But don't be too quick to destroy them, as war can break the supply of resources you depend on ! Attacking freighters will destroy resources, with the potential to cause an economic crisis.

Recommended system
64-bits Windows or Linux system (32-bits systems are not supported)Intel Core i5 or equivalentGTX 970 or equivalent4GB of RAM5GB of free disk space
Linux-specific support
Linux is fully supported, with the following caveats.
AMD users should launch the game with the "-vulkan" command-line parameter (full command "HeliumRain.sh -vulkan"), using the open-source radeonsi driver.NVidia users can encounter a NVidia driver regression causing the game to render entirely white. Until this is fixed by NVidia, affected users should prefix the launch command with "__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0" (full command "__GL_GlslUseCollapsedArrays=0 ./HeliumRain.sh"). We anticipate this issue to be resolved soon.</p></li>

We here at ENIGMA TECHNOLOGIES have created a revolutionary new tool to help us find out.
With DREAMSCAPE, we can represent the mind of an AI through an interactive 3D environment thatwe can explore!



[CAUTION]
As theDREAMSCAPE is a reflection of an AI's mental state, be aware that the DREAMSCAPE of a contaminated AIcould become unpredictable.
No need to worry however, asthis recruitment exercise is only a simulation of what a real DREAMSCAPE would look like.
This exercise serves to train people like you to become effective RADE agents. What does RADE stand for, you ask? Simple. It stands for Ro-[[DATA REDACTED]]



[DESCRIPTION]
THE ENIGMA MACHINE is a short first-person science fiction horror game that aims to capture the obscurity and unpredictability of games of old, framed within anincreasingly unsettling presentation.
A unique fusion of glitchy mid-90's 3D graphics and VHS effectswith more modern graphical effects for a distinctive visual style.
A series of puzzles which force you to think outside the box.
A blend of traditional first-person controls combined with point-and-click mechanics for satisfying interaction with the world.A story that could only be told through the medium of games
AVERAGE PLAY TIME:60-90 MINUTES

(One last thing. The game isn't over until you see the credits. :) )


[REVIEWS]
"There are some offers I cant refuse. Would you like to poke around inside the mind of an unstable AI? is one of them, and the 15 minutes Ive spent so far with The Enigma Machinehave made me glad I seized the opportunity."

<p>In the distant future, humanity has discovered a method to replicate matter through the use of a Dimensional Gate. Industry is revolutionized overnight and a short period of chaos gives way to all warring factions uniting under a common banner.A few years pass and the peace brought about by Gate Technology crumbles once a new threat appears; a race of energy parasites that have crossed through the Dimensional Gate by mimicking the very materials humanity had believed they were replicating. Mankind is quickly overtaken as their technology is turned against them and the energy emitted by the parasites begins to take control of those exposed.In an act of desperation, the experimental RSK9 is constructed, a ship made of Pre-Gate materials and technology with the ability to absorb parasite energy and use it to power its incredible arsenal. Piloting the RSK9 is Alys, an ace pilot previously missing in action that has returned seemingly immune to parasite control. Her skill and resistance to the parasite energies influence make her the only pilot capable of preventing the extinction of mankind.
GAME PLAY:
-Increase your B-Meter & firepower quickly by flying as close to enemy fire as possible and absorbing their energy. The closer you fly, the more energy you net!
-Fire your weapon while flying close to enemy fire and absorbing to perform powerful "Risk Shots". Enemies destroyed by these powered up shots will turn into energy to power your shield. The best defense is a risky offense!-Fly like an ace pilot and utilize Barrel Rolls to quickly cover vertical space & modify your attack!-Unleash the Barrier Breaker once the B-Meter is full to inflict huge damage on everything in sight!
-Playing for points is fun again as higher scores are awarded for explosive bursts of destruction and taking risks! Destroy multiple enemies at once and utilize "Risk Shots" to string together combos and increase your score multiplier!
-Experience different facets and paths to the story based on your performance and actions taken during missions!</p></li>

<li><a href="https://dual-wield-software.itch.io/the-land-of-glass">https://dual-wield-software.itch.io/the-land-of-glass</a>
<p>The Land of Glass is a card game with a twist: speed. It's CCG meets action RPG, combining card collecting and deck building with frantic combat. Choose your heroes, build your deck, and save Vitrerran.

A Real-Time Card Game
The Land of Glass is a new kind of card game, one where combat doesn't go back and forth in precise turns but operates in real time. The strategy and synergy of typical CCGs is present; however, you'll need more than that to succeed. The monsters won't wait for you to choose your best cards.
Combat takes place over two ever-changing grids: attack and defense. Punish your foes with big, heavy blows or swift strikes while countering with a steady stream of defense cards. Use magic to infuse your attacks with fire, ice, explosions, and more; lay traps; burn away defenses; and slow your opponents down for some needed breathing room.
Magic is not confined to simply attacking and defending, though. Alter the playing field itself with massive spells, from fields of fire to lightning storms to man-eating plants. There are nine different types of magic to find, and experimenting is key to survival.
A Character-Driven Story
A knight is sent on a quest he cannot complete. A misfit believes he has ended the world. A mage searches for answers. A blacksmith demands revenge. The portals were supposed to make Vitrerran a better place. They were supposed to save the continent, to unite a divided people. Instead, they brought ruin. Instead, they brought monsters.
The Land of Glass is an RPG with eight protagonists spanning four campaigns. Each character is forced to explore the world for the first time, to confront his biases and misconceptions as he tries to stop a magical plague that threatens to eat the continent. While set against an apocalyptic backdrop, The Land of Glass tells stories that are both personal and smallit is a character study first and an epic fantasy second.
Because not every quest is noble, and not every world is worth saving.

<p>Love Hues! is a university-based visual novel packed with both character and world secrets. You'll be playing asSkyler (changeable name and pronouns) and navigate your first few months at Falls West University, where you'll meet 5 romanceable - or befriendable! -  characters who hide certain truths about themselves and the world around them. This is the full version of the game!
Love Hues! features 41 unique endings, 5 routes,  228,000+ words, and 32+ CGs.
Twitter - Love Hues! Website - Lemmasoft
- 2018 Demo
Characters

Every character's True ending  can be unlocked whether you play their platonic or romantic route.
Toby: 19 years old, they/them. Toby's full of energy and keen to kick off their studies in post-secondary - and to join Falls' soccer team! They're troubled by their past with a certain other Falls student... 
James: 20 years old, he/him. James is a flirty and cheerful student who is determined to become a doctor. He seems to be struggling with his academics and well-being lately. Loves archeology and is close with Devlin.
Nova: 18 years old, she/her. Nova's your neighbor in the dorms, and she's often out researching Falls' strange past. She's dedicated to and protective of her friends, especially Ava. She may be more entwined in Falls'secrets than she tells most folx. (Please note: Nova's route is only unlocked after 1+ ending(s) has been achieved!)
Devlin: 20 years old, he/him. Devlin is the students' union volunteer coordinator but tends to seem impersonal. He's passionate about the union'ssuccess and works tirelessly despite rumors of its financial troubles.
Ava: 18 years old, she/her. Ava rarely appears to be on campus and tends to be anxious and withdrawn. Knows more about Falls and the 'Curiosity' than most. (Please note that Ava's route requires all True endings to be unlocked.)
Choose wisely...


Certain choices in routes will add new scenes to other routes you've already experienced or will unlock secret content. Learn as much as you can about Falls' true origins by exploring the game from every angle, and see if you can understand what everyone means when they whisper theCuriosity's name...

Pick your appearance and pronouns!
Pick the main character appearance you like + your pronouns - you can romance or befriend anyone in the cast regardless of your choice!

I wish that there were games like this when I was growing up. Two Beard Gaming"These are the sort of LGBT games we need to see more of." Rainbo Press"The pixel art is simple, yet beautiful, and the soundtrack by Jessica Kelly is as haunting and mysterious as the story that unfolds. It's well worth a play. Stevivor

<p>LOVE is a minimalistic platforming game with a retro aesthetic and a focus on a challenging but not unfair difficulty. It has an innovative respawn system, 16 levels, a 12 track soundtrack, online leaderboards, and a unique custom level creation feature*.
Users are able to create images (both static and animated) that can be imported as level geometry, hazards, or interactive elements. Creators can craft full 10-level campaigns with customizeable screens and intros, and share them with one another*.The challenging levels are balanced with the inclusion of a simple yet unique respawn system wherein the player can leave a checkpoint at any location at any point, as long as they are on solid ground.Beyond the visual aesthetic, the challenging level design, and the abundance of features, there is the fantastic soundtrack composed by James Bennett, which bring the seemingly simple 3-color atmospheres to life.
*LOVE Custom is only available on Windows

LOVE isnow available on Steam. If you buy the game on itch.io, you will also receive a Steam Key!
The soundtrack is available tostream for free on Spotify.

<p>Cook, Serve, Delicious! 2!! is the massive sequel to the surprise best selling original, one of the few games that gives players complete control on how they want to build their restaurant.
The game starts like any other morning at SherriSoda Tower as you take the elevator up to open Cook, Serve, Delicious!, a platinum star restaurant that was surging in popularity thanks to your amazing chef and management skills. Just then, a swarm of police surround SherriSoda Tower. It seems the SherriSoda head executives were secretly stealing funds from the company at the same time they were incurring a staggering amount of debt, draining the accounts of the tower and several of the businesses inside of it, including CSD. Just like that, the tower was closed and put up for federal auction, including everything inside of it. It was all over the Cook, Serve, Delicious! restaurant was no more.
Angry but determined to rebuild, youve scrounged up all of your personal lifes savings and bought commercial space inside the Teragon Supertower, the largest skyscraper in the city. Its here that you will start a brand new Cook, Serve, Delicious! restaurant, build it back to its former glory, and rebuild your legacy as the best chef in the world.
Features include:
A 60+ hour experience as you build your restaurant from a roach infested eatery to a World Class Platinum Star experience by either running your own restaurant or branching out as a chef for hire, where you take jobs within the tower and various restaurants as you gain experience with the large array of foods, which spans 400 levels across 33 restaurants!
Several modes including Classic Mode that brings back the classic gameplay of the original, Stress mode that instantly rockets the difficulty to the highest setting, and Zen mode, which allows you to take it easy and relaxes many of the stressful elements to provide an easy day of cooking. All new gameplay features and additions, with a greater flexibility of difficulty for those who like it casual or insanely difficult.
Over 200 foods, sides, drinks and desserts to choose from, a staggering increase from the 30 foods in the original game.
New local co-op mode! The all new split screen co-op feature allows you to play through the entire game with two players, with the ability for players to drop in and out during your progress within the game.
Tons of lore including an email system with over 600 emails, unlockable secrets, and tons more!
Unlock over 1,200 restaurant objects and design your restaurant however you'd like with the Designer mode.
All new 1080p native/60fps code.</p></li>

MAC AND LINUX USERS 
Builds for MacOS and Linux are offered here, based on manifest interest on past titles. But please note that it is not possible on our end to do even basic testing on those versions, so there is a distinct possibility they might not work properly.Moreover, since the new Catalina update, games made in Unity might not work properly or at all, and this is out of our control. If you are using MacOS Catalina and encounter issues with running the software, we most probably won't be able to help.
Please contact us if you come across any issues with those versions and we will see what can be done (if anything) to help create stable builds for those systems.</p></li>

<p>Congratulations!
You and your friends are graduating from the prestigious Intergalactic Time Academy. No time for partying though as your first mission awaits! The Orbees are all missing. Yes, those curious little beings made of energy who power our time-tech are nowhere to be fou... no, wait! We have a faint trace on their signal. Are you brave enough to rescue them?
Prepare yourself for unknown dangers. If you find some of the Orbees they might equip your Space-Time Machine with new tech. Decide who is in charge of each gadget and combine your abilities to discover the best strategies.
Use cunning, comradeship and co-operation to survive and never forget the Academy motto: BFF or Die!
Best Friends Forever
BFF or Die is a game for you if:
You want a 2-4 player game to play with your partner/family/friends where you get to do everything as a team.
Pure co-operation sounds fun to you as its a different feeling when you all work together.
You like games that are easy to start playing but then gradually get more challenging.
You like games that let you figure things out yourself rather than hand holding you too much and telling you what to do.You want a game with a fun, short campaign mode which adds replayability by having difficult trophies to collect and also an unlockable Infinite mode.
Is There Online Multiplayer?
We do not have native online multiplayer support BUT you *can* play with your friends online by using Parsec. Parsec (which is free to use) lets you share games with friends by streaming your screen and sound  to them. Their inputs (control pad or keyboard commands) then get sent to you and with almost no lag (depending on your computer and internet). This let's you play  real-time online co-op together..!
What to Expect
We strongly recommend playing in co-op 2, 3 or 4 player mode as this is when the game is most fun. Playtime will vary depending on your skill level but as a guide:
1-Player story game: 2-3 hours
2-Player story game: 2-3 hours
3-Player story game: 2-3 hours
4-Player story game: 2-3 hours 
The Infinite Trials: 1-999 hours! Or maybe  hours :) Complete as many randomised/procedural levels in a row as you can without losing. Go back to the start if you die.
You can either share controllers (two people per controller) or have separate controllers. As a minimum you need the keyboard and one control pad to have a 4-player game. Or you can use four separate control pads, its up to you.
Theres a story mode with 30 levels followed by an unlockable Infinite Trials mode with challenging randomised/procedural levels.
Is Your Computer Fast Enough?
If you have a dedicated graphics card and your laptop or desktop PC can normally play 3D games then you should be able to run BFF or Die just fine.

If you have a high resolution screen (like with newer Macbooks) then you will probably want to set the bootup options of the game to 1920x1080 to get a smooth frame rate unless you also have a super fast graphics card to match your high screen resolution.</p></li>

<p>Welcome to Interactivity: The Interactive Experience, an exhibition by Aetheric Games, featuring The Button.
In the world of "video-games", interaction engineers have spent years rigidly defining the specialised and determinate ways that you, a "video-game" protagonist, may interact with your world. Here in this guided tour you will find them all, glistening with promise, awaiting the click of your mouse and ready to edutain you! Please enjoy.
Except for The Button. The Button is not for you.
. . . . . . . . . .
Interactivity: The Interactive Experience is a short meta-narrative experience about how our interaction with game worlds is limited by convention, in equal parts of awkwardly-funny and oppressive. Explore the gallery in first-person, solve a handful of simple puzzles, and find a way to push The Button.
After several years, the gallery has been refurbished withnew details, textures, tweaked puzzles, more endings, achievements and original music by Miles Tilmann. (The sound track is also available on Steam, along with an achievement enabled version of the game.) This new opening of the galleryhas been described as The Stanley Parable meets Groundhog Day via David Lynch. The curator makes no such lofty claims, and advises you to stay behind the red cordon ropes at all times.

<p>Tristram Rose appears to be a simple tailor, living and working in Inverness in Scotland in the mid-18th century, but then, hes an expert in keeping up appearances. In actuality, Tris is immortal, and has lived centuries moving from town to town in order to leave any suspicions behind him. He also has a remarkable ability: a healing touch which he similarly refrains from using, lest he be labelled a witch.
But when love comes knocking, its hard to keep cautious. After revealing his powers to save the life of his partner Alasdair, Tris finds himself at risk of exposure  both as someone with supernatural gifts, and as a man who loves other men.
By noose or by carriage, Tris is leaving Inverness.
If he flees, Tris will lose everything and be left destitute on the streets, but if he stays to earn enough to start a new life, he risks the gallows. Fortunately, at that moment a woman in dubious clothes with an equally dubious background approaches him requesting an expensive commission.
Three paths lead forward. Should Tris try to mend his fractured relationship with Alasdair, seek help from his enigmatic client, or dive headlong into work to fund his escape?
Help him find his way through his last Inverness nights.

Over 65,000 words of queer, supernatural-historical fictionThree distinct story pathways: prioritise your work, your relationship with Alasdair, or befriending your mysterious clientAt least two endings to each path: will you run from your problems, get someone killed, or make amends?Approximately 90 minutes per playthrough; playing all three paths is recommended, for at least 4 hours of gameplayMore than 20 lush illustrations showcasing the finest in 18th century fashionPastel colour scheme and authentic baroque soundtrack to soothe the dual stresses of sewing and exes

Content Warning: contains gore, sexual references, emotional/physical abuse, alcoholism, depictions of racism and homophobia, body horror, discussion of gender dysphoria, suicidality, implied suicide, description of dead bodies, institutional abuse/police brutality, and profanity. Recommended for ages 16+Note: a large part of this game is about the institutional abuse of LGBTQI+ people, how that abuse is amplified for LGBTQI+ people of colour, and the way it filters down into interpersonal abuse and fractured communities. While the final/'true' ending of the game is hopeful there are many difficult and confronting scenes throughout the story, as well as a number of bad endings. Please consider the above warnings carefully before playing.

<p>***Development of Volo Airsport is on a permanent hiatus***
Latest version: v3.7.4 Parachute Release
Volo Airsport is about the joys of skydiving and the beauty of nature. Try your hand at wingsuits, either flying as close to the mountains as possible, or soaring high and enjoying the view.
Flying with a human body is an experience that is fundamentally different from piloting other aircraft; it can be as elegant as it can be clumsy. As such, Volo completely simulates the motion of your body, and you can see, hear and feel the way it interacts with the air around you.
The core gameplay is all about learning to master the complex interplay between your body, the wind and gravity. Your first few flights can be quite like learning how to walk for the first time! Don't worry though, unlike in real life you can always try again.
Enjoy, and blue skies!

Note: You get a STEAM KEY with your Itch.io purchase!
VR Support
Volo supports both the HTC Vive and the Oculus Rift CV1 and DK2. 
Note: Only gamepad and keyboard+mouse controls are supported! No motion controls.
Early Access
Development of Volo Airsport is on a permanent hiatus.
Volo is also available on Steam and on Humble, if that's your thing.

Become a trickster charged with protecting a small village.Teach the villagers lessons and chase after your worldly desires. Then see what sordid tales these mortals tell of your bizarre interventions.
Lord, what fools these mortals be!-Puck, A Midsummer Night's Dream
Tricksters is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-5 players. One player will take on the role of the Facilitator (GM), the other players will embody unique tricksters charged with protecting a village.
The Village is created collaborativelyby answering questions, leaving the look and feel of the game setting up to the group.The tricksters are comprised of their True Form, Human Form, Tricks and Desires all of which are up to the players. There are no lists to chose from or powers to pick.
The game mechanics are simple focusing on the two most important things for a trickster, Teaching a Lesson and Fulfilling a Desire. When you need to make a roll you build a pool of six-sided dice based on if you have help, you're using a trick or are trying to resist a desire.
In the end you'll come up withthe moral or expression the villagers use toremember this little fable you've told.

<p>
Astack of news article sits on your desk, two stampers on each side - green to approve, red to reject. Your reporting team is hacking away in the background as corporate music plays through the loudspeaker. It's time to make decisions. Will you endorse nationalized healthcare, even though your love interest is worried about increased wait times? Will you demonize the new synthetic alcoholic drink, even though your boss stressed they are an important investor? Will you support current government, as tensions grow between the neighboring country?
After work, you emerge on the streets of Novistan, shaped by the very news you publish. Perhaps you will see more graffiti, angry bums or even a riot? Or perhaps you will turn the nation into peaceful utopia, filled with cameras and drones watching your every step? How will your channel address tragic events about to happen? Will you agree to meet the clandestine group of truthtellers, or stop to watch the Prime Minister's speech?On the way home you meet with three main characters: Evie, your co-worker and immigrant, worried about her health and growing xenophobic sentiment; your brother Justin, an aspiring comedian struggling with impostor syndrome and social anxiety; finally Rudy, a single father trying to provide for his little girl and keep his store afloat, while a mega-mart opens up next door. Each day provides a glimpse into their life and how the media shapes their beliefs.But every Headliner deserves to relax at home from the stress of the job. Listen to the radio and unwind on the comfy couch bought with hard-earned cash, as you watch the city burn outside the window. Perhaps splurge on treats to feed your doggo? Adopt a drone? Have your brother over for dinner? Or maybe keep your doors locked, hoarding every penny, as your apartment slowly fills with piles of cash?After good night's sleep, it's time to once again face to boss, new articles, a growing sense of responsibility, and.... power.

<p>Lead Your Followers Into the Future!
Your word is gospel in this god sim set in Sub-Saharan Africa. Influence and try to control your followers using commandments but beware, free will leaves these open to interpretation. Will you create a flourishing civilization or lead them to death and destruction?

About This Game
Welcome to Crest, a unique take on the traditional god sim, where your word is gospel. Control and guide your followers by issuing commandments written in an evolving pictographic language.
How these commandments are interpreted and remembered is not set in stone. What you communicate and what experiences your followers have with the environment is the basis for their religion. Over time, commandments can develop different associations and completely change their meaning. After all, your followers still have free will and will sometimes do what they think is best for them, regardless of what you had in mind.
The consequences of your actions may not always be clear and you will need to be aware of the ever-changing environment, your people's beliefs and their feelings about you. 
Will they love, respect or fear you?
Key Features
Create your own religion, nurture your followers and observe how they evolve, or die, as a result of your decisions - including the unintended consequences of your commands! 
Sandbox-style gameplay: Oversee a world where weather, vegetation, mineral deposits, drought and animal behavior will create surprises
Weave your own stories through trial and error. The history of your people will be chronicled and presented to you at the end of your vigil using the in-game storybuilder.
Progress by unlocking new words, increasing the complexity of your commandments
Customize the difficulty of your games with various amounts of resources, animals, islands and overall island quality
Built-in Twitch support: When you live-stream the game on Twitch, your viewers can join your cities and vote on commandments to help or disrupt your godly plans
Setting
Crest is an Afrofuturist game that reimagines how humanity arose in the cradle of humankind on the African continent. It's a historical themed game that tries to emulate an advanced iron age civilization that could have existed a few thousand years ago. The setting for the game world, its flora and fauna is based on African biomes, with rainfall determining the tug-of-war between desert, savanna and jungle.


Progression and Losing
Every new world you start is unique and will write its own stories. If all your followers die, that world is gone forever. However, you will still be able to view the legacy of your previous worlds. As long as your people live you can continue playing and further shape your own history by creating more and more complex commandments with newly unlocked words.

<p>
In Behind the Magic,youll create a fantasy mockumentary by playing a group of incompetent adventurers on a quest to save the world.Players take turns setting up and acting out scenes in character. These scenes are interspersed with reality-television style"confessionals" with the Bard who is documenting their journey.
Key Facts
Players: 4-7, no facilitator neededTime: 2-3 HoursPreparation: none, though one player should be familiar with the rulesLocation: A single large space where players can move around and act out scenesMaterials needed: A printed copy of the rules, at least one chair, nametags (optional)The game starts with~30 minutes of setup where you select a quest, build the setting, and create your characters. Then you'll spend 60 - 90 minutes playing out the adventure and seeing if the heroes succeed... or at least don't make things worse.The scenes themselves feel like structured improv, without an audience. Each scene has a question or tension embedded in it and players act it out until they're satisfied. Example: The party tries to calm down the mayor after accidentally burningdown the town.People are saying great things about the game:Every time I've played Behind the Magic it has been the ideal combination of brilliant, stupid, and adorable. It feels like the perfect D&D session brought to life - a parade of calamity and failure with lots of heart.  Jason Morningstar
Even in alpha, this game made me laugh until I cried at several points. It's such a delight.  Anna Kreider
Randys game Behind the Magic is some of the most fun Ive ever had playing a LARP. Jeeyon Shim
The rules are written for embodied play, walking around the room in character. However, there are variant rules for playing it at a table. The game has been playtested thoroughly with beginner and advanced storytellers and works well for players of all skill levels.</p></li>

<p>Latest Update: 2-17-20
Don't have Clickteam Fusion 2.5? Head on over to Clickteam's website!
NOTE: RPM Plus REQUIRES the Fusion 2.5+ DLC!A version is available for standard Fusion 2.5 as well!
RPM - Super Basic Edition (RPM v1.0) is now free!
Visit the official topic on the Clickteam forums for support and more!
Check out Volnaiskra's volCAMERA for an additional camera system for RPM!
A new general purpose FastLoop platformer movement engine designed  for Clickteam Fusion 2.5! RPM includes:
Float-based, for smoother character movementFastLoop-based collision detection, which can be modified even during playCan be Frame Dependent or Frame Independent (Frame Skipping)Character Linkage: Simply add you character to the Group.Player qualifier and the engine automatically applies basic animations and sets it to the maskGroup-Based objects: Turn active objects into solid objects, jump-thru platforms, moving platform, ladder, etc.Slopes, including slopes that can be jumped thru the bottomSupport for Horizontal, Vertical, Rotating, and even Physics moving platformsBuilt-in pause functionCustom smooth scrolling CameraOptions to toggle Jumping, Crawling, Crouch Jumping, Ceiling Slide, Jumping Down Platforms, etcBasic XBOX Controller support, with the option to easily add more thru the Player Input Widget (which the engine reads as input)Basic Metronome, which can detect beats and off-beats, and determine accuracy. Animation Control Widget: Enable or disable any of the basic animations (even from behaviors) to allow custom animations, or used "Forced Animation" to manually control an animationUses XBOX Gamepad, Physics, and Advanced Direction extensionsIncludes a super basic example starring my character, Angela!Basic 2-Player supportGenerate multiple "rooms" within the same frameOption to toggle 8-Direction MovementAnd many more...
This movement can be used commercially, non-commercially, or for learning purposes. The only stipulations are that the engine source cannot be shared/re-sold, nor can the Angela character be used commercially without explicit permission
The demonstration file contains an .EXE with 4 examples I developed to see what type of movements I create. This includes Yoshi's Island, an "Out-of-the-Box" sample, a "Greninja Gaiden" type thing (using the excellent sprites by Neweegee), and a basic Shantae example (mostly to test animation). Be sure to read the control file, there's a lot of stuff involved!
All of the demonstrations run on the exact same code, using behaviors and widgets to make each character different.
For legal reasons, the demonstration characters are not included in the paid packaged. They're a free download to show how the engine functions!  However, you do need the engine source to actually use them, as they rely on behaviors.
This works best with the Windows exporter.
Special Thanks:
NB-The-Dragon, Neweegee, Luke T., Kritter, DinnerSonic,  darkFunction, Volnaiskra, Furriokun, Johnathan Verge, Aroka, Charmandrigo, Zevifa, and tons of others <3Update 2-17-20-Cleaned up some leftover code from the Player Attributes Widget.-Added the ability to disable RPM's Animation system in the Engine Widget.
Update 2-15-20
-Added BoostX to the Player Mask, BoostX Decel to the Player Attributes Widget, and PlayerBoosting to the Player States Widget. This is an additional layer of speed that can stack on top of the current XSpeed of the player. Use Num.Pad 4 and 6 for a temporary boost in speed. This utilizes the RePosX feature of the Attributes Widget, so keep that in mind if you use it for something else. Note that by default RPM will not apply any animations while boosting, so special animations need to be manually added.
-Added a simple Wind Tunnel gadget that pushes the player upwards. If you hold the jump button, the player can launch out higher.
-Redid the Ceiling Detector scaling to factor in different mask sizes. The Engine Widget now records the mask's original width and height at the start of the frame to determine how large the detector should be when the player crouches. The ceiling detector ideally should be about 6 pixels high.
-The size of the mask when crouching was adjusted to be 12 pixels by default, or half of the original size.
-RePosX/RePosY will no longer apply if a detector collides with a wall, as opposed to relying only on pushout.
-Pushout strength (forcing the mask out of scenery)can now be modified in the Engine Widget.
-The default Ground Correction Loops value is now 30.
-The default Stick To Ground value is now 3.
-Fixed an issue where the mask would sometimes be pushed back a few pixels if you jumped into a wall.
-Fixed an issue where disabling Player Collisions didn't actually disable all collisions.
-Fixed an issue where using Player Pause would still add towards FloatX/FloatY, which would hinder collisions and the camera.
-Fixed an issue where the Climbing animation wouldn't play if Ignore Player Pause was active.
Update 2-14-20
RPM Lite has now been superseded by RPM: Super Basic Edition! Super Basic Edition is a re-release of the original RPM from 2016. It contains more of the core functionality of RPM compared to the original LITE release, though it still contains less than half of the amount of events provided in RPM Plus.
Super BasicEdtion will be released as-is,with absolutely no support or bug fixes to be applied. Many features have been added or changed since this release, which is only available in the paid version of RPM.
Update 2-8-20
-Added the Player States Widget. This widget determines which actions the player is performing, and how long they're performing them. Examples include how long the player has been walking, if they wall jumped, if they fell through a platform, if they shorthop, and plenty of other options. This is meant to abstract and consolidate different values RPM uses into a single object so it's easier to check and understand different actions. The Angela player sprite now uses some of these states to determine if certain actions are possible. The widget will be added to the debugger at the start of the frame.
-Added support for the latest version of volCAMERA by Volnaiskra. If you own a copy, you can paste over certain events to enable its use in RPM. For further documentation on how to use volCAMERA, contact Volnaiskra on the Clickteam Forumsor on his website!
-Added the ability to toggle collision detection on Jump-Thru platforms. If Flag 31 is activated on any object in the Jump-Thru Platform group, collision detection will be ignored for that object.
-Added Enable Hold Jump to the Player Attributes Widget. This makes it so when the player holds the jump button, the mask will always jump when they land on the ground. This also applies to Wall Jumps.
-Added Aerial Crouch to the Player Attributes Widget. This simply allows you to perform a crouch even while airborne.
-Added QuickTurn Speed to the Player Attributes Widget. When Quick Turn is enabled, this adjusts how fast the player can turn around when they press theopposite direction. Originally this used a needlessly complex formula just to reapply the current Deceleration.
-Added BurstSpeed Deceleration to the Player Attributes Widget. Acceleration was modified so that it no longer applies if it's greater than the MaxXSpeed.This originally caused an issue where if the player continued to hold a direction, they would decelerate quicker than normal than if they made no input. RPM will now slow down the player using the BurstSpeed Deceleration value if they travel faster than normal.
-Modified the Ceiling Detector so now when the player crouches, the object itself will increase in size. This makes it easier for the object to detect any potential narrow platforms to keep the player crouched. This won't apply to any jump-thru slopeplatforms, as the Ceiling Detector helps determine if one can be landed on.
Note that the Crouching state in the mask's "Animations" was cropped. If you added anything that uses YTop on the mask, it will need to be adjusted.
-Modified Push-Out to factor in walking into a potentially tight corner. The mask will be nudged backwards slightly depending on what direction and sensors areoverlapping the background.
-Fixed an issue where Jump Buffer didn't actually work at all. It can now be altered from the Player Attributes Widget, and is enabled by default.Jump Buffer allows the player a few extra frames to jump after they walk off of a platform. By default, RPM gives 6 frames.
-Fixed an issue where the mask could still be in the Crouching state during a Wall Slide if they did a Crouch Jump.
-Fixed an issue where the climbing animation wouldn't play properly if Crouch Jump was enabled in the Player Mask.
-Renamed Mercy Invunerability to iFrames
-MultiJump in the Player Attributes Widget is disabled by default, but can be re-enabled by simply changing the default MaxMultiJumps value.
-Automatic Detection in the Engine Widget is disabled by default. The default Ground and Top Detect values are now 4.</p></li>

Kaiju Big Battel: Fighto Fantasy is 16-bit styled RPG featuring turn-based combat, plenty of exploration, and a funky soundtrack to pump you up. This is an officially licensed game based on the live-action monster wrestling group Kaiju Big Battel, who have been performing their Godzilla-meets-WWE act for over 20 years.
Designed for Kaiju fans and newcomers alike, Fighto Fantasy takes players on a quest across time and space as they work to undo damage caused by the evil Dr. Cube as he rampages through history in search of fame and glory. With seven main playable heroes (and a secret one to unlock), players explore six time periods and punch out dozens of deadly monsters.All the world is watching as the Kaiju Big Battel Title Fight is about to begin: The diabolical Dr. Cube vs. the patriotic pugilist, American Beetle! Things take a sudden turn when Cube pulls out a secret weapon that rips open portals into history. Now it's up to the Kaiju Heroes to pursue Cube across the centuries, from Egypt to Rome to Russia and beyond! Is the mad doctor pursuing dangerous artifacts lost to time, or does he just want to deface famous landmarks with his own ugly mug?

 Combat: No random encounters here; touch enemy NPCs on the map to trigger turn-based battles. Each of the seven main heroes has their own strengths and weaknesses. Side stories: When you're not chasing Dr. Cube through time, take a minute to help out some locals. Slay a musclebound mummy, rescue lost Kaiju heroes, adopt cats! Map abilities: Each hero has a unique ability to interact with environmental objects, unlocking hidden paths and secret treasures. Difficulty selection: Easy Mode for a relaxed experience, Normal Mode for players who want some tense fights, and Hard Mode for players looking for more deadly dangers. 12+ hours of RPG adventure.Super Walrus Games has been making independent games for over 15 years, starting with the release of Walthros in 2002.

<p>FLUX presents a variety of experiences: Interactive fiction with a series of mini-games that challenge you to type, hack-n-slash, organize or fidget to earn credits and purchase numerous cosmetic items: hairstyles, helmets, outfits and upgrades! Designed to allow players to alternate between chill and twitch-based game modes, the game provides players with a number of activities to engage with.
Wanderer, a blue-haired ex-military swordsman, spends their nights joy riding/flying through the streets/skies of a sprawling cyberpunk cityscape. Through conversations with Wanderer's girlfriend and local NPCs you'll learn more about the world and reveal many answers to mysteries surrounding those that live there.





Numerous Minigamesin One: Fiction,Beat-em-up, Typing, Fidget, Rhythm, ReflectiveMeditative Minigames: Take on a variety of jobs that assume different genres goals and objectives, each with a unique pace.Cosmetics + Cybernetics: Earn credits throughout your experience and spend them on new outfits, helmets, hairstyles and augments for your body.Customizable and Chill Tunes: Listen to the 80s Chillwave groove provided by Quantum Dylan or replace the provided .mp3 files in the install directory and create your own soundscape!Compelling World: Text your girlfriend, listen to the news, interact with your environment and converse with locals to learn more about the games characters and world.Built inFlash: Yeah, THAT Flash, which means the file size is small and loading times are nonexistent!

Flux's game modes are treated as "jobs" each day. By participating in one, you shift the game forward in time. Each mode has a Flux value, representing the game's music volume and speed rate, that rise and fall depending on the mode's mechanics:
Groove: A traditional rhythm activity tasking players with pressing the correct inputs atFreestyle: A fidget style game where you define your own rhythm, reflect and zone out to the beat.Challenge: A typing-oriented game where you are given random letters A-Z to press. This tests your awareness of each letter's position on the keyboard.Spelling: A typing-oriented mode where you are tasked with spelling out entire words to increase your Flux.Glyph: A visual challenge where you must rotate the objects on the right with the arrow keys to match the positions of the objects on the left.Rash+Slash: An action-oriented mode that pits you against incoming enemy robots. Use your trusty katana to cut your way through the enemy!Assault: A beat-em-up mode that throws you into the heat of battle, challening players to survive a gauntlet of robots and enemy soldiers that are armed to the helmet with special attacks, a variety of weapons and keep on coming in waves.Mecha: Like Freestyle, but in the open skies above the city. Reflect, find your groove and enjoy the view.Armament: An action-oriented mode that has you defending the skies with your Mech airship. Take out the incoming robots with your blasters!

In order to add your own music you must have the following: an mp3 format music file, the file renamed to "track1", "track2", "track3", "track4"or "track5", and finally the file must be added to the game's included Music folder. Once the game is run it'll automatically load up these tracks sequentially as you begin to cruise. If you want to play another song, simply stop cruising and begin again to "skip" that track!
If you enjoy the music as much as I do,give Quantum Dylan a listen!

<p>"[...] through unsettling art and clever sound design, Paranoihell delivers both a spine-tingling world and pulse-quickening jump scares."
- Andrew King, Bloody Disgusting
"PARANOIHELLmay give it a supernatural slant, but it captures that awful fear that curls up within us when we find ourselves all alone on that long walk home."
- Joel Couture, IndieGamesPlus


"It's a long walk home..."
After finishing her bar tending shift at 3am, Erica Yu encounters a strange man who claims to know her. Before things escalate, the man suddenly disappears. Terrified, Erica reluctantly decides to make her way home... but little does she know, the nightmare has only just begun.

<p>Funomena's award-winning Luna is now on itch.io


Overview
A Bird's peaceful summer slumber is disturbed by the majestic call of a mysterious Owl. Enticed to swallow the last piece of the waning Moon, Bird is blown far from its Golden Gate home.
Re-awaken shadowy forests and bring life back to sparkling lakes. Discover hidden creatures, help Bird reunite the fragmented Moon... and find its way home. 
Solve celestial puzzles to unlock each level's tree, plants and animal spirits.
Place, customize and interact with them in miniature, musical terrariums. Bring each world to life, revealing Austin Wintorys haunting, enchanting score.
Brought to you by Funomenas uniquely diverse team of veteran developers (Journey, Flower, Boom Blox, The Sims 2), Luna is an interactive fable about learning by the light of unexpected mistakes.


Luna started off in partnership with Intel and their RealSense Camera technology, but as the project evolved, and hand-tracked VR controllers began to emerge, we partnered with Oculus to bring the game to the Touch. The non-VR PC version was released shortly after the original launch date. The storybook edition later updated the core game with avoice over narrative & localized subtitles to further elucidate Luna's heartfelt story.
You can find out more about how the idea for Luna came to be through these tweets by Robin Hunicke. Luna is a very personal game for Robin, and we hope it'll touch you like it has already touched others across the world.



Reviews
Without so much as a single word, Luna traps us within its narrative fantasy, quickly switching its focus to puzzles so we discover the truth in metered, literary chunks.
Gameranx
This process is truly special and unique because the more time you take with it, the more beautiful and rewarding the world will look...
8.6  The Nerd Mag

	Dare to travel the absurd and dangerous Orion Trail, where only the luckiest, bravest, and most stubborn captains will make it all the way to the end. Come face the terrible and weird Synapsion Brain Beast. Cower before the pedantic might of Baxxtor the Instructor. Submit to the overwhelming cuteness of the three eyed Warp Weasel. Become famously incredible or incredibly dead!

Ultra Cool Space Features
A high-stakes and hilarious journey through the strange, stupid and terrifying locales of the Orion Trail!

Choose your crew, name them after your friends, and watch them die! Heroically! Or, you know, maybe they'll survive. Anything can happen!

Tons of random encounters, each with a variety of options and outcomes. You'll probablynever encounter the same thing twice! You might, though.

Away Missions! Send an Officer (with a few of your invaluably expendable Redshirts) into the fray. The rewards are great, but so is the risk

Carefully manage your Resources: Food, Fuel, Hull, and Redshirts. Curse loudly as they're whittled away.

Play to your strengths! Each captain, and officer provide different bonuses to increase your chances of success.

Succumb to the chaos of the Probability Drive. You can rely on your Crew's abilities, but there are no certainties in space.

Chiptune soundtrack by Rainbow Kitten.

Gorgeous retro pixel art.

<p>Mall Kids is a simple tabletop RPG about teens who work at a mall and the events that make up their daily lives. You won't be fighting monsters (probably) or saving captured royalty (most likely) but you will be interacting with your friends to collaboratively tell a story about how rebellious teens deal with the brute force of consumer-based capitalism.
Check out the upcoming expansion Mall Kids:More Malls, More Kids.

Kind Words
"Tonight's game was the most fun I've ever had roleplaying. I ranMall Kids for a very full table and now we are #cinnabonded. I literally laughed for 4 hours straight and my face hurts and my heart is so full." - Jillian,@OrbWitch
"The thing I love about Mall Kids is how successfully it mashes Grant Howitt-inspired gonzoism and John Hughsian soulful teen drama. It's goofy like Honey Heist, and yes somebody did turn into a bird, but we also explored the nervous excitement of a teenager asking out his crush for the first time."- minorsolfege

<p>
	The Novelist asks one central question: can you achieve your dreams without pushing away the people you love? The game focuses on Dan Kaplan, a novelist struggling to write the most important book of his career while trying to be the best husband and father he can be. The Kaplans have come to a remote coastal home for the summer, unaware that they're sharing the house with a mysterious ghostly presence: you.


	Read the family's thoughts. Explore their memories. Uncover their desires and intervene in their lives. But stay out of sight; you can't help the Kaplans if they know there's a ghost in the house. It's up to you to decide how Dan's career and family life will evolve, but choose carefully; there are no easy answers, and every choice has a cost.


	Dan's relationships  to his work, his wife, and his son  react and shift in response to your choices. With a different sequence of events in every playthrough, The Novelist gives life to a unique experience each time you play


	The decisions you make will define the Kaplans' lives, but they may also tell you something about yourself.

	Visit a quiet town in the Peruvian desert at night searching for spirits and taking photos, then sharing these pictures with locals who free-associate based on them. This game is based on time I spent with a brujo in the desert suburb of Cachiche, a town that was founded by witches during the Peruvian Inquisition. Here descendants of witches still live and continue to practice traditional healing and fortune-telling.



	"What works here is that uncertainty space... In a number of places you'll see shadows that don't have a body. And you'll also see people discussing secrets in dark rooms or running past you hurriedly from behind fences. But this only adds to the underlying feeling of something sinister and ominous present, watching you, following you wherever you go..." 
Kill Screen 


	"It's all pleasantly dizzying, like a fever dream."

	FEATURES 


Explore a 3D world with ambient sounds, voices and textures from the Peruvian desert, a living environment at night.
Use your photography as a means of conversing with non-player characters, revealing what they see as well as what they imagine. 
See yourself as an outsider, lurking in alleys, eavesdropping on conversations, going where you're not supposed to go. 
Watch the forces of tourism at work and the conflicts rumbling beneath the surface of a small town. 
Discover that your camera is not just a passive recorder, but that its act of observation can change the environment. 
Complete progressively more abstract quests and delusional journal entries. 
Export and share your photos.

Set fifteen minutes into the future, AIdol is about a new craze thats been sweeping Japan: virtual idols.Virtual idols look like normal humans, but theyre made of wire and circuitry. They can sing better, dance better, and entertain better than any human could ever hope to, and their devotion to their jobs is unfailing.The protagonist, Hana, is a young high school student who loves virtual idols - particularly Aiko. Aiko is the postergirl of the famous company Lyriq, and one of the most popular virtual idols to ever exist. Aiko is the nations darling, and though Hana adores her, she knows shell never get a chance to speak to her. Aiko is simply too far out of her reach.That is, until one day, when somebody claiming to be Aiko starts sending Hana text messages asking for help. Aiko tells Hana that shes in severe danger of malfunctioning, and the only person who can save her is her original programmer but nobody seems to know where they are, and nobody is willing to help her.Left with no alternatives, its up to Hana (and an eclectic cast of characters she meets along the way) to save Aiko from being turned into scrap metal!

<p>The full version of Little Bug is here!Get Nyah HomeNyah is walking home from school when she's suddenly cast into an uncanny world where dangerous spirits linger restlessly in bottomless canyons, icy caves, and moonlit deserts. Play as Nyah and her spirit light in tandem as you immerse yourself in this foreboding, atmospheric landscape. Will Nyah use her new found light to find her way home or will she lose her way amongst the many dangers that roam in the moonlight?

Simple Controls, Complex Gameplay:Nyah can walk on the ground and collect treasures while her light can fly in any direction - you control them both at the same time. Forming a telekinetic beam between them, youll create a powerful connection that can swing Nyah to new heights, destroy barriers, thwart spirits and light the way to secret locations. Your coordination with these two characters is key, as disembodied spirits can appear without warning and hurt Nyah or her light. Youll learn their unique play style intuitively and quickly as fresh challenges emerge to test you in the wilderness.

Discover Dozens of Unique ItemsCollect dozens of unique treasures in Nyah's lunchbox that reveal memories from Nyahs past and rearrange them however you like. Decide which items to keep with you on your journey and which to offer to the mysterious spirit cat Roadkill, who can unlock secret challenge levels with special items.

<p>Armed with a simple yet stylish revolver and six devastatingly plump bullets, you must reset the security mainframe to restore order and reap the rewards of a job well done. To succeed in the game, players will need to move carefully and make smart use of their bullets, items, and the environment as rushing into new areas is the fastest way to get killed in the untamed wild of the neon corridors.Limited AmmunitionBegin each attempt to reach the mainframe with just six bullets for your revolver that must be picked back up after each shot and manually reloaded one by one - make them count.A Plethora of ItemsDiscover items and perks to aid you on your way to the mainframe. From homing bombs and coin magnets to a teleporter and high heels, each item will change up your approach. Choose wisely as you can only carry one item unless, of course, you find a backpack.Shopping and BankingWhile death is permanent, money in the bank can live on for future attempts at reaching the mainframe. Make a deposit or withdrawal from one of many conveniently placed automatic banking machine throughout the facility. Or just blow your cash on a shopping spree - up to you.Life DecisionsInvest in items like Life Insurance or a Last Will that, if carried during the time of your unexpected death, will save your money, bullets, bombs, and keycards for your next attempt.Aggressive Creatures + Malfunctioning SecurityFace down dozens of nasty creatures lurking around the colorful hallways and the now malfunctioning security drones meant to defend against those same creatures.

<p>Raise your shield. Embrace Lady Tallowmere's dungeons.
Indulge Lady Tallowmere. See how far through her lovingly violent dungeons you can delve in this 2D indie action roguelike-inspired platformer.

	New rooms are procedurally generated every time you play, meaning you'll have to be on your guard for every randomly-placed enemy, elite, boss, and treasure chest you'll come across.


	Each room gets progressively bigger, harder, and more rewarding the further you go.



The concept is simple yet hard to master: Raise your shield to block enemy attacks.  Lower your shield and strike your foes when the timing is right.  Jump or move to avoid traps, or raise your shield to reduce damage taken.  Find the key to advance to the next room.  Collect weapons, outfits, headgear, and shields of various rarities to aid your journey.  Turn in souls from slain enemies to increase your base stats and passive abilities.  Stay alive as long as you can!

Brace yourself with your shield as you learn the quirks of each foe and trap so you can strive for that "one more run" high-score victory! Each dungeon is infinite in length so it's up to you to push your limits; a local scoreboard lets you track your greatest efforts.

	Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and Android. Play with keyboard (and optionally mouse), or use your favourite gamepad/controller.

Tallowmere offers single-player and local co-op madness (up to 4 players, desktop-only) for fun frantic couch gaming.
	To those who will be lured into Lady Tallowmere's dungeons: good luck.

System requirements
The Adventures of Elena Temple should run on most Windows computers that aren't on display in a museum, but if you have one that doesn't run it, you have my deepest sympathy.
Just to be safe, you should have at least the below specs. But to be 100% safe, download the demo first and check if it runs ok before making any purchase.
OS: Windows 7+ / OS X 10.9+Processr: 1.5 GhzMemory: 2 GB RAMStorage: 200 MB disk spaceVideo card: 512 MB, DirectX 9.0cKeyboard or gamepad
Heads up!
The Adventures of Elena Temple is just one game you can play on seven simulated machines. Aside from the different look, the game plays the same on all machines and has the exact same content! The purpose of these old machines is to remind you of the old days, so feel free to pick whichever you like best without any fear of missing out on game content.
Please download and play the demo before making a purchase!
I don't want to mislead anyone into spending money on the game. That's why I made this demo version, so you can try it and see for yourself if you like it and if it works properly on your machine. And only then buy the game, if you consider it's worth your money.
Thank you for your support!</p></li>

(Uh-oh!)
Of course, Beracus and Lee don't have that kind of time! Not only do they need food, water, and air to simply survive, they must return to the surface to continue their search for an the all important cure.

Prisoner 134. You have been purchased for testing and are now the property of BioMass Labs. Knowing nothing of the place you have been brought to, your only option is to enter the maze and solve the puzzles in the experiment.In 2194 humanity has populated the entire galaxy. As our existence expanded, crime became harder and harder to control in the vast reaches of space. As a result, laws became more strict. Government attempts to wrangle the issue bolstered a growing police force and, over many years, the reach of law enforcement grew larger and more aggressive. The general population, simply wanting to feel safe, grew more accepting and the first fully commercially run prison systems took form.
Nearly one hundred years later, in 2290 imprisonment is common place. A blind trust has been placed in the commercial justice system eventually landing every day people in jail for years for even the smallest offenses creating a massive divide between the idea of prisoner and person. Hundreds of commercial prisons and law enforcement companies thrive.Devaluing of prisoner lives and massive prison overpopulation gave birth to an auction system where anyone could purchase prisoners for any use free of legal ramifications.Acquired in the most recent bulk order of prisoners for BioMass Labs, you are being shuttled off for study at the Kohate testing facilities. No information is known about the details of the study.You have been black-bagged, loaded onto a transport shuttle, and are waiting for law enforcement to release you to the company.

The subject is a sci-fi horror puzzle game designed to combine a mix of classic puzzle adventure games with horror elements.You will need to learn to navigate the complex to find your way to the various puzzles set out in the experiment and discover the reason behind the testing.You are being monitored by those running the tests and are required to visit a bio-data terminal periodically to record your vital signs and other data for record keeping. If you fail to do so, you will be removed from testing by euthanization.

<p>A Game for one player with a deck of playing cards, 3 six-sideddie, and either a lighter, scissors & tape or a redmarker & a black marker.

UIT//MS is a game about dealing with the social anxiety around interacting with the same people day in, day out, over the course of who knows how long.
It takes place on a single day in one persons life and represents the last hour or so before their work day ends.
During play you build a spread of cards that represents both the people youre talking to and the conversations you have during that time frame.
You roll dice to determine how your character perceives the impact the conversations have on their friends, and how they themselves feel after. You answer question prompts to determine details, and you try to make it to the end of the day.
CONTENT WARNING:
This is a game about anxiety, and playing it can lead to a headspace related to those kinds of feelings. It also involvesscissors, tape, and sometimes fire (though it does have alternate rules for those events allowing markers instead). Do not use these elements if they make you uncomfortable or you cannot do them safely. Burn things in a sink with a working faucet or a cup of water nearby, and be careful to not burn yourself.</p></li>

<p>Race cars in classic motorsport style. Each corner is a chance to outmaneuver the other drivers, every straight a flat out drag race. Fast-paced strategy relies on your reflexes to pull off split second maneuvers. Feel your car's momentum, find the rhythm of the track, and drive like a racing driver.
Guide your car's driving line to take each corner quickly while finding a gap to overtake other drivers. On straights, be quick on your gears and late on the brakes to get to the corner first, always on the edge of spinning or crashing out. Spend an entire lap trying to close the distance to the car ahead, choosing the right corner to make your move. 
Other drivers break your rhythm, forcing you to adapt your driving and how you tackle corners. Each track is unique and you have to learn the fastest route through corners and sections. Rain changes your car's behavior while you deal with decreased visibility. With a simple control scheme, victory will come from out-thinking and out-driving everyone else.
Inspired by the classic era of formula racing around the Mediterranean, each environment is a colorful and hand-built racetrack, all alongside an originally produced surf rock soundtrack.
Featuring
Four player local and online multiplayerRaces award points to compete over a multi-race seasonSingle player practice to learn tracks and hone your drivingTwelve unique tracks and environmentsSimple, three button controls are easy to learnDifferent weather modes to add a twist to drivingOriginal surf rock soundtrackStylish Mediterranean localesNote: Online play requires Steamworks, but every purchase will come with a Steam key for no extra charge.

<p>You wake up with no memory. Your day is starting off great!
Nepenthe is a hand-drawn RPG with a terrible sense of humor. Set in the strange world of Carithia, you play as a creepy bald dude who lost his memory. Yes, you read that right. Meet some very polite monsters, and battle both them and your sense of self-dignity in epic bullet-hell fight scenes.
Definitely not a potato in a trench coat
Sporting a childish hand-drawn art style, Nepenthe is sure to either make you love it at first glance, or throw your computer away. The developer of Nepenthe takes no responsibility for such actions, and recommends drinking chamomile tea. Its really soothing, he says. You should really try it one day, he says. What was I talking about? He asks. There is an awkward pause.
designed for non-psychopaths, mostly
With three different endings, and countless side-quests, Nepenthe is designed for ultimate replayability. This can get quite annoying if you need to share a computer with someone else. Trust me. Almost every monster can be spared, for added challenge and less violence. They can also be killed - dont worry, you psychopaths! If you enjoy dad-jokes or Chinese water torture, Nepenthe is for you.
Be psychoanalyzed by a monster!
Nepenthe is designed for both casual and hardcore gamers alike. Explore two "modes," "Adventure" or "Story," to find the play-style that best suits you.
Story or Adventure?
"Adventure" mode is a bullet-hell extravaganza, with ever increasing difficulty as the game progresses.
Battling legislationis always hard

"Story" mode's battles are easy one-click things, designed for those who just want the story, not the gameplay.

Battle Ninjas! ...if you want to, of course, we're not suggesting you actually do it..

<p>WARNING: This game contains flashing images. If you experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain light patterns or flashing lights then immediately discontinue use of this game and and consult your physician before resuming gameplay.
You wake up. A disembodied voice tells you that you have been trapped in a time loop with your future self. They have committed a terrible crime in the near future, and - according to this voice - the only way you can escape the loop is to convince your future self of the wrongness of their actions.
It seems you have no choice but to follow their instructions, but that doesn't mean you should believe everything they say. As you progress in your conversation with your future self, it becomes very apparent that something is amiss. Someone is lying to you. The question is: who? And why?If you want to be free, make sure you figure out the truth.Think carefully. Think strategically....and good luck.

<p>You've just gotten a new job!

Yes, you're the new apprentice for Death. The Grim Reaper.
It's your job to help gather souls. Only thing is, you can't just go and kill people to get their souls, it has to look natural, like an accident! And you can make this job in a very fun way, using amazing powers to do things like flood places, turn machines on and off, create dangerous chemical reactions and much more. That means for example setting up bottles, knives, brooms, and other regular objects in such a way as to create deadly (as well as amusing) chain reactions.
The Death's Life features a series of challenging puzzle in different daily situations. To advance in the game you must find and interact with the objects in the scene to solve the puzzle, triggering a sequence of events and causing the "accidental" death of your victims.
Try a day in Death's Life. Dying has never been more fun!

<p>This game lets you try on the role of a Supernatural Newspaper Agency boss and editor. The world it takes place in is a dark and haunted one, with ghosts, zombies, monsters and even shapeshifting murderers, pretending to be human after they have stolen their victims' bodies or infiltrated the humanity. It was inspired heavily by the works of H.P.Lovecraft and it builds on the atmosphere of uncertainty and noir of the 1940s.Send your sextet of weathered journalists, detectives and occult specialists to investigate murder, affair, and horror in the Town.Each time, the story will be different. Sometimes, a werewolf is shredding innocent (and less innocent) victims to pieces and it is your task to unmask the creature. Other times, it will be a body stealing alien from outer space, a mummy that some misfortunate archeologist has excavated and is now haunting them. Perhaps it will be Jack the Ripper, still mysteriously alive and lurking in the streets at night.Or maybe there is a really bad big tentacled monster hidden in the cellar of the University?It is for you to find out and entertain your readers while bravely standing up against ancient evil.Daily Chthonicle homepageRock, Paper, Shotgun reviewBig Boss Battle review</p></li>

Encounter monstrous creatures and let curiosity guide you through an inevitable voyage of extinction.The water rose by an unpredictable amount due to climate change. The sun started losing power and the Earth's surface froze over. Humans were forced to live underwater, where they could still harvest energy and grow food, changing how cities and districts looked. As resources began to dwindle in the year 2971, sub-aquatic spaceships were sent to a nearby wormhole to look for habitable planets. Things did not go as planned, as the ship, Argo9, returns millions of years later in a time humans have gone extinct.It will be up to the player to determine if the ruins of our species is a travesty or an inevitable conclusion as they explore the waters and encounter deadly underwater monsters.Controls: movement WASD || shooting/aim = LMB/mouse || Change weapon = Scroll/"Q" & "E"/Numb keys or you can use a gamepad (xbox controller recommended). So this is our first big game! We haven't made a big game before so it's really exciting to make something of this scale, but also a bit like just being two people wrestling a colossus.

"It has a deeply emotional narrative that will resonate with the player after 15 minutes is up and the game ends" Art as Games

Ted and Molly are together. Ted feels a connection to Molly wherever he looks.
But, how do they both really see the relationship? See each other?
"Thing-in-Itself" is an interactive short story about the struggles of understanding another human being. Using Immanuel Kant's concept as a framework, it leads the player through stages of a relationship, exploring how perceptions may clash and surroundings can alter.
With an average walkthrough time of 15 minutes, "Thing-in-Itself" is not a game in a traditional sense  it doesn't have win or lose conditions and doesn't present challenge to the player.

<p>Once upon a time, there was a boy named Peet who slept peacefully. When he opened his eyes, he found himself in a nightmare.
Upon waking from a coma, Peet's girlfriend is nowhere to be found. Investigate the screams coming from the heart of Blackfork Asylum, the increasingly violent behavior of the grown-ups, and the strange truth about Peet's past in this hauntingly dreamlike fable.
From Red Wind Field to the haunting halls of Blackfork Asylum, explore six moody, illustrative levels.Fight your way through hordes of bosses, monsters, and blood thirsty grown-ups with your trusty baseball bat.Immerse yourself in a breathtaking piano-centric soundtrack.Join your quirky child-hood pals and trusty pet bird on an adventure to discover the truth about your recent coma.
Neversong is all about the death of youthfulness, but more importantly, the redemption one can achieve after the loss of that innocence. It's about discovering who you really are, deep downwho you were when you were a kid.The game deals subtly with some dark themes; we want to communicate not only the sneaky nature of depression, but also the tremendous value in remembering who we are despite our circumstances or present mental state. The goal of the game is to make sure you know that you are valuable and loved.

Once Upon a Coma [now 'Neversong'] looks as somber as it sounds.

'Once Upon a Coma' [now 'Neversong'] is the Intersection of 'Night in the Woods' and 'Hollow Knight'.- Rollingstone

Neversong disturbs me on a deep level. Im having a good time playing, but it is constantly reminding me of dark subconscious journeys Id rather forget.

Intense risk-vs-reward puzzle action
Run into or stomp on an unprepared boxto apply tape, then stomp on it to move it along. Clear multiple boxes in a single stomp for a score-boosting combo! Just be careful: Stacks that get too tall eventually get toppled by an indestructible penalty cube! Try to work for as long as you can before getting launched out of your workspace by falling boxes, laser beams, or blasts of fiery energy. 
'No worries' arcade-stylegameplay
This game is pretty difficult, but don't sweat it. Play to beat your personal best score, for bragging rights, or just for fun! Losing, learning, and trying again is part of the game, so don't be discouraged when your shift comes to a close. Combo Postage has no ending, so feel free to play as long as youd like. (Just make sure to take breaks- and dont play too much, OK?)


Rebindable keyboard and gamepad controls 
Move, jump, climb, and stomp with just three inputs! Most gamepads work automatically- just push the action button. (Right face-button by default.)


Custom mode and stat tracking
Head to the Custom room to set up and play a custom shift. Turn on and off laser and burner cubes, change how quickly the game ramps up in difficulty, and more! Check your Standard mode stats in the Records room, including your best shift and how many boxes you helped ship out. If you're feeling social, you can chat with your coworkers- nopressure, though.

<p>BONUS - Cellpop Goes Out At NightTexas is launching on itch.io with an all-new mini-sequel, Cellpop Goes Out At Night. The sequel is included in the Dusty Skies Edition.Grab the bundle, here: The Real Texas - Dusty Skies EditionThe Dusty Skies Edition is only 50 cents more than the base game-- please buy that instead! :)Customers who already purchased The Real Texas before July 12, 2016 will recieve the Dusty Skies Edition FREE. It's my way of saying "Thank you!" to the fans who have bought the game over the years.OVERVIEW"These days, folks have a lot of funny ideas about what makes a Real Cowboy..."The Real Texas is an action adventure game that plays like a mashup of Zelda: Link to the Past and Ultima VI. Sam, an ordinary Texas rancher, is on holiday in England when he steps through a blue portal and into a purgatory dimension, Strange: Here, a friendly witch is handing out guns to visitors. A crazed, German-speaking wizard hurls elecbolts from his castle. And upriver, something's going on that involves a lot of chickens. Stuck in the middle sits Sam, a Real Cowboy.... But that's just his job title back home-- it's not obvious that it's of any practical help here!USER REVIEWSThe game has been out for awhile-- here's some reviews from other sites:"This thing is like some bizarre voxel dream, with its square, swaggerin' cowboys and its castles and insane German wizard-scientists and talking rats . . . It's fun and beautiful and a little bit rough on purpose, and I suppose I'll never forget it." - Abram03"i will never forget this surreal nostalgic ride. i haven't had such a rewarding experience in a long time." - countersweet"This game is incredible and I cannot recommend it enough to everyone." - MicrowaveFEATURESKill things with six types of classic cowboy and fantasy weaponsRummage through peoples' houses without fear of retribution while they go about their daily businessHelp people out with their PROBLEMS (*rolls eyes*) often by shooting your gun many, many times-- just like real life!Many special items and powerups, optional areas, and two types of chicken cutlets to collectWear a bullet-proof vest underneath a sequined evening-gown if you wantSupports all main game/life perlis including boss battles, enemies, traps, the estate taxIMPROVEMENTS AND OTHER NOTESFor the re-release I added achievements, improved the framerate, added more compatibility options, and optimized things generally. Even without the mini-sequel it's a lot improved over the original release. But I was careful to NOT ret-conn the original game. People seemed to really like it, so I wanted to respect that by not changing it up in any way.To complete The Real Texas takes maybe about 10 hours, depending on what you want to do. Cellpop Goes Out At Night might take about 1-2 hours. Both the main game and the sequel have lots of secrets and weird things to uncover. In fact, there are some things that still haven't been figured out (to my knowledge) in four years... So I made it an achievement. Ha-ha! Good luck. :)I've put a lot of love into both of these games, and I hope you will find them special and enjoyable. Thanks!</p></li>

Welcome to the OmniMyth
OmniMyth: Fables is a character-driven fantasy roleplaying game where the adventure is secondary to the friends you make along the way. You'll wield unique and powerful weapons and abilities to fight back the forces of your Guide's imagination. If you feel so inclined, traipse through the scenic town ofTana's Dell and discover the sordid alchemical secrets it contains between the trees.
Principles:
1. Subvert the hero's journey:It's great for stories, but makes for a poor group play experience.
2. Play the character that you want:Classes can be restrictive. This is my take on a "classless" RPG system, which instead allows you to create your own abilities and have some flexibility in how you change them as you level.
3. Combat should be interesting and fast paced:No more slog-boring, phone-checking combat sessions. OmniMyth has fast-paced, brutal combat where the tables can be turned at the drop of the hat.
4. Death should be interesting:Death is boring in an RPG. Throwing away your old character and rolling a new one can feel heartbreaking. So, how about playing as a ghost instead? Or going on a quest to come back to life? Death in OmniMyth can be the beginning of a new play arc.


OmniMyth: Fables is full of beautiful illustrations and tips for a successful campaign. In addition, you'll find a blank character sheet for your use.Form-fillablecharacter sheets are available at OmniMyth.net

The ability creation system allows you to create more than 500,000 unique spells, techniques, and abilities to accurately represent your character's skills, personality, and goals.
Also featured at OmniMyth.net is a random character generator, so that you can jump into play with a unique character at a moments' notice.
Updates:
OmniMyth: Fablesis a beta of the final OmniMyth gameand may undergo changes in the following year, when the final version is released all those who purchased a copy of OmniMyth:Fables will be given the PDF of the final release version of the game.
Community Copies:
If you purchase the game at $12 or more I will add additional community copies. These copies arefreely available to those who are otherwise unable to purchase the game. The $12 copy of the game comes with a small hand-written thank you message from the author on the "inner cover" of the PDF.</p></li>

9 Till Void is a turn-based deckbuilding roguelike that features neither deck nor cards. As the newly-appointed Spellsword of these lands, you must fight your way through the corruption, with an arsenal of carefully chosen spells, to reach the source of darkness and destroy it from within.

POSITIONAL SPELL SLINGING
9 Till Void is played on a 9x9 grid, where each row correlates with one of your spell slots. You can only cast a spell if your character occupies the same row on the board as the spell, so your position always matters.

<p>REVIEWS
For three bucks on Steam its a no-brainer if youre looking for a good way to kill time before bed or, if youre a true sneaky mastermind, at work while you should be writing memos and whatnot.  Game Space
Nearly everything about this game is an absolute delight... Steam Shovelers
The game, needless to say, is very funny. With multiple locations, blocky visuals and a jaunty soundtrack, Ripped Pants at Work is a delightful blast of stealth-based fun. Red Bull Games

Ripped Pants at Work is afrantic stealth game about searching for new pants. Players control an ordinary office worker on their first day of work. After an unfortunate incident involving a pencil on the floor and pants that were way too tight, the player must venture out of the office and into the city on a hunt for new pants.
Explore a small, open city filled with different pairs of pants! Players can challenge themselves to find the most pants in the shortest amount of time. Some pants are easy to find. Some are a bit trickier!


This happens to everybody! Ripping your pants is one of those things that everyone can sympathize with, but it's still so embarrassing. Every time you play, you'll control a new, randomly generated character!
If you find pants successfully, you'll continue as the same person. If you get caught with no pants, you'll be fired and play as the next person hired for the job!





Sneak
	through a small, open-world, city, full of unique locations and
	people.
Break
	line of sight, hide behind people and in bushes, and run across
	streets and through buildings with a unique brand of frantic stealth.

	the game as a different, randomly generated character every time. If
	you get caught pantsless by too many people, you'll get fired for
	indecency. The cycle continues with the next person to get hired for
	your job.

	your personal record and see how many pairs of pants you can get in

<p>The crystals return!

	Crystal Control II is the follow-up to one of our most successful releases. The original game, released in 2014, was a competitive game for two local players with some bullet hell elements. Because that core gameplay seemed to resonate so well with the fans, we decided to stick pretty closely to the original formula for the sequel...but with some interesting new twists!

Features:

Local multiplayer action for two! Fight for control of the crystals to gain more firepower and take out your opponent...you only need to get one hit on them to win!
Easy to learn, hard to master! We've seen players of all skill levels pick up the game and understand it's simple controls. Don't let the simplicity fool you, though! The skill ceiling can be quite high, giving room for the competitive folks to shine.
Eight playable characters! Each character has different movement speeds, charge shots, and "Control" abilities (which can be executed after capturing more than half of the total crystals on-screen)!Solo practice mode! Crystal Control II was designed from the ground up as a competitive game for two players, but if you don't have a friend nearby you can still enjoy our new target practice mode. try to get a high score on every stage!


This game is best enjoyed with one or more gamepads!
Crystal Control II is best played with two gamepads, but the game also includes two alternate modes if you only have one (keyboard vs gamepad or shared single gamepad).
Unfortunately, it's impossible to play the Versus mode of Crystal Control II with keyboard only. Most keyboards have a limit on simultaneous key presses that is much too low for the number of keys Crystal Control II would require (which means that key presses would be dropped randomly and create unfair matches).
Solo Mode, however, is playable with either a gamepad or a keyboard.

They are alone, seeking a secret place. They are dead set on getting there.
Black Mass is a roleplaying game about two people leaving a community that doesnt want them, to the woods that calls for them. Those travelers, Lydia and Catherine, confront their pasts to seek their ownblack mass, a moment of transformation, to put the tools of change into their own hands.
Black Mass is a tarot-based tabletop roleplaying game played in one sitting over the course of two to three hours. Black Mass is for four to eight players, including aproctor, who facilitates the game.

Black Mass is a pointillistic tarot-based roleplaying game where players share responsibility over two travelers, Catherine and Lydia.
Players take on portions of their personalities, calledpersonas. We join in their successes, their defeats, and we all sign their names into the devil's book together. During a game of Black Mass, players take turns inhabiting different elements of their histories, personalities, and tendencies. Personas revolve around relationships, emotional experiences, discovery, and growth. Each persona is different and sketches out a different piece of each character. Each player gets two: one for Lydia and one for Catherine.
We play to find out who they are, why they left Salem, and what they find in the woods. Once we know that, well find out what they do after their black mass.
Black Mass is a game about discovery: through play we learn about Catherine and Lydia, informed by the in-play personas. No two games are similar, and no two Catherines and Lydias are the same between playthroughs. There are ten personas for both Catherine and Lydia, resulting in many unique combinations at the table.

Throughout the game, players draw tarot cards to overcome obstacles and to add to thespread, two rows of cards in the center of the playspace. The spread represents the lives of Catherine and Lydia, each card symbolizing a moment in their past, present, and future.
Tarot cards act as action resolution and oracles. When a persona begins inhabiting Catherine or Lydia, the player draws cards from the central pile and adds those card to their personal stack of cards, called thecairn. Players spend cards out of their cairn to move silently, shrug off spectral voices, bear the cold, and negotiate their path through the woods. Only one player may act as Lydia and Catherine at a time, and when theyre out of cards, they're no longer in control.
At the end of these turns, players may add a card to the spread, narrating a scene from their present or past.
Theproctorof Black Mass facilitates the game, providing challenges for the personas, and taking actions. The proctor guides the personas through the prologue, confronts them in the woods, and sets them free during the black mass.
Black Mass has three modes of play, October, December, and February. An October game of Black Mass has bubbling cauldrons and flying broomsticks. A December game of Black Mass focuses on eerie exploration and introspective journeys. A February game of Black Mass has cloven hooves and bloody snow.

<p>Story
Take control of a modern hero of our times, a man so lazy he decided to quit his job and just spend his life inside an All-you-can-eat diner. As years go by, his freeloading nature becomes legend, but then a tragedy occurs - the diner is about to close down! Will our hero finally settle down and get a regular job? Never!!!
Embark on an epic quest filled 
with humor, puns and controversy as you traverse the city in search of a
 solution to your life's problems.
Memorable characters 
include yourself, your dad who is also your only friend, a very foxy 
secretary love interest (but that just doesn't work out... at all), and 
half a dozen more
The plot takes a dark turn when the CEO of a Megaslimy corporation and the Mayor of whatever team up to do some evil. 
Can you stop them and more importantly - do you even care?
Gameplay
All You Can Eat is a unique interactive comic that blends the mechanics of playing a game seamlessly with the experience of reading a comic:
every
 interaction in the game world (such as talking, picking up items, using
 objects etc.) creates a new comic panel, furthering the story
at
 any time during the game you can scroll up and down to read what you've
 created among hundreds of unique hand-drawn (and hand-scanned!) content
 rich panels
the in-game conversations mimic the 3 panel structure of daily comics with context, setup and delivery
when the player ends the game, he is given the option to print out his gameplay in a comic book format
a new game+ option with a developer commentary track when you finish the game</p></li>

Brathian
A long time ago Brathian was a land full of magical energy.Many wars were fought for that kind of magic and so, to bring peace back, the elders decided to seal as much magical energy as they could in one crystal and hide it.Many years passed, and the books telling this story were found. Someone read the books awakening the guardians of the crystal and shaking Brathian.The descendants of the elders, Edgar and Amy, took to themselves the duty to defeat the guardians, gain their power to fight whoever is tryingto take the crystal.

Turn-Based Combat
Take advantage of enemy positioning and timing to fight safely. Potions and certain weapons can be thrown at enemies.Tip: When "Zzz"s appear above an enemy, that indicates it won't act for a turn. 
Full Story and Soundtrack
Hand-built levels are interspersed with generated ones to tell a linear story. Each section ends with a  unique boss encounter.Progress can be saved at checkpoints.Over 10+ songs!

Tips and Tricks

Go easy on the weapons! Their stats and abilities don't stack, so it's a waste of precious space. Equip just one or two, and support them with artifacts.With multiple weapons equipped (like a sword and a whip, in this example), use the number keys to select between them. Only one may be used at a time.

Kite enemies whenever possible! Attack while they're resting, and step away while they're not. You can do this repeatedly against anything slower than yourself.Mouse over enemies to see their stats. Some have nasty abilities (like poison!) that will kill you if you aren't prepared. You can also see their speed and remaining HP.  

Throw potions at enemies and bosses! A well-placed debuff like slowness or confusion can makedifficult battles easy.Your own effects can be viewed at the bottom right. Note that you cannot stack the same effect more than once at a time, so drinking two regeneration potions in a row is unhelpful.

In this fast-paced, action puzzle game, you will need to defend your home against a band of heroes intent on ending your un-life and taking your treasure.
As heroes assault your domain, you will need to combine essence in order to summon monsters for defense.
Match 3 of the same type of monster on the grid to gain some essence. Acquire enough of the same essence to summon that monster.
Your monsters will fight against the heroes, stalling their advance and keeping them from reaching your inner sanctum.
Every monster type and hero has unique stats: Health, Attack, Physical Defense, and Special Defense, and each monster and hero will attach with either Physical or Special. Based on these stats, your monsters will fair better against some heroes than others.

Your realm contains 7 locations, each with it's own, uniquemonsters. When a hero is left unopposed by your forces, it will gradually, but steadily advance through the current location.
When the hero reaches the end of a location and moves on to the next one, your leftover essence will be used to construct a temporary, magical barrier, which will block the heroes from advancing for a short time.

<p>Aurora is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players. This game is deliberately designed to be played comfortably while practicing social distancing or together around a communal table when the necessity for distancing has ceased.
Your story is built and told in three modular phases:
1. Crafting a unique deck of Oracle cards through the mail, using your friends zipcodes to randomize prompts and elements of your illustrations. Phase I is available as a free demo as part of the Step Up for the Postal Service game jam.
2. Using those cards to build a flawed City corrupted by Darkness and populate it with hopeful citizens who aspire to overcome those flaws with Light.
3. Acting out the story of the overcoming of darkness in favor of light, using your characters and cards from prior phases to bring hope and revolution to your world.
To play, you need a few friends, some paper or note cards to write and draw on, and a method to communicate. 
Aurora is available as a high quality printed zine at worldchampgame.co/store. This game was made possible by supporters at patreon.com/worldchampgameco in May 2020.

<p>Ruin everything. You are a banker. You want to extract as much wealth from the world as possible--or, at least, more than everyone else. You will manipulate the global economy in order to siphon money into your secret Swiss bank account. Whoever has the most Swiss money in 12 turns wins the game.  Play solo against the AI or multiplayer against people who will imminently cease to be your friends.  Buy votes. Unlike most strategy games, you will never have access to armies and never directly control territory. Instead, you will spread your influence throughout the globe by purchasing votes in parliament, or selling your votes to incite a military coup. You always share power with your rivals, waiting for the moment when you can backstab them.  Make free trade agreements. Re-route industrial wealth throughout the world, from Mines to Factories via exploitative trade agreements. Remember: your goal is to make a profit, NOT to improve the world.  Manipulate the IMF. Control the International Monetary Fund to force policy decisions without a regional parliament's approval. Basically, screw over your opponents without them being able to do a thing about it.  The map is upside-down Because why not.</p></li>

<p>
A small village known as Windy Meadow may not be rich or famous, yet it offers something even more valuable: harmony. Gorgeous views, serenity of the forest, gentle rivers and fertile land... Even beasts and dragons seem to usually keep their distance.
Nevertheless, not everyone can find peace here. The time has come for three young people to decide what are they going to do with their future. And its happening much sooner than they would wish for.
WillVena, the best huntress in the village, stay with her family? Is it better to take the lucrative job offered by distant merchant guild?
Fabelwants to become a famous bard, but his rough past complicates so many things. Should he follow his dream, or is it finally time to wake up?
And isIudicia, the local outsider and talented herbalist, going to marry a man she doesnt love? Is spending her future alone and lonely the only alternative?

Three intertwined stories.For 2,5 hours you get to play as three protagonists with their own problems to solve. Each route offers different moods, topics and perspectives and all of them share the dramatic, final chapter.A multitude of side characters.Their varying personalities and complex relationships make this community feel alive and relatable.An immersive, detailed village.You get to visit multiple buildings and outdoors and see how they change over the course of the game. The carefully thought-out fantasy setting reflects through both the dialogues and visuals.Choices matter.Choice-shaped endings significantly shift the game's atmosphere, while even smaller decisions influence dialogues, events and how your protagonists are perceived by other characters.Heart-warming scenes.A unique mix of coziness and melancholy supported by colorful pixel art and emotional music.Animated visuals.Unlike most Visual Novels,Tales From Windy Meadowreplaces the majority of narration with animated character sprites. More than 99% of the in-game text represents dialogues.

<p>About the Game
Concept
In 2015 I released an album, entitled Refactor. Several of the tracks started out as OSTs for aborted game projects, and most of the others were inspired by my love of video game music in general. Iwanted to make some music videos for the songs to pay homage to the games that inspired them
In 2017 I quit my job to go indie, and figured that Ishould make a bunch of small, simple games while I figured out what I wanted to be doing long-term.
These separate ideas were refactored into a single one.
Early Access
Because this game will be in development for quite some time, Iam providing early access to the game as I work on it.As Ipush new builds fairly frequently, the best way to play is via the itch.io app.
Since many of the tracks are produced for game jams, Iwill always have a freely-downloadable version for any current jam that the game is submitted for so that other participants may evaluate the jam submission.
If you want to give feedback about the game so far, feel free to use the comment section here on itch, or come find me on Discord!

You're a ghost. You're not sure why. You awaken in a world a with a whole lot of questions and not a whole lot of answers.
Make strange friends... Uncover secrets... Gather... eyedrops?
Something tells me we're gonna be just as confused when we're done here. Maybe even more so...

Ghost Story is a story driven action RPG currently being developed by me as a solo project! I'm still very much a beginner at game-making but doing this project has taught me a lot and I'm excited to learn even more as I continue.It's still pretty early into development but I have completed this demo of theprologue chapter for people to enjoy. :^)
This demo is playable with keyboard or xinput devices, and is available on the following platforms:
WindowsmacOS (COMING AT A LATER TIME CUZ IM BROKE IM SORRY ;n;)Ubuntu
Caution:There are a few scenes that those who arephotosensitiveshould be aware of: (bright flashing lights, rapidly changing colors). However, there is an in-game option to dampen these effects. The game will ask you early on if you are sensitive to such things. (I'd also recommend answering yes to this question if you are streaming the game or recording video for a lot of people to see.)
Note: Configurable controls are only available for keyboard users at this time. Gamepad configuration is planned, though.

	Available on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) Sept. 30th!

One Bullet:
That's right one bullet. Only one dang bullet. If you shoot it, you're going to have to catch it again. Catching bullets sound pretty dang hard? Well don't worry, because Friday Night Bullet Arena features... 

Screen-wrap Action:
You'll never lose your precious missile because when it leaves the screen it just comes popping right back in from the other side! Catch your bullet again in order to fire again. Catching other players' bullets is... not recommended. You know what they say, "If you love something set it free, and hope that it destroys all of your friends."
- Screen-wrap Action isn't actually trademarked :( 

Bullet Catching: 
	Hit by your own bullet? Hey no worries, that just means you picked it up and can fire it once more into the fray! In fact you should probably do this a lot if you want to stay alive and rack up points. Like all the time. Shoot catch shoot catch shoot catch shoot catch win! 

Maybe don't get hit by the other players' bullets too. 

Endless Fun:
Oh yep here come the buzzwords. We've sold out already. If you need us we'll be at the bank.

<p>ISSUE #4
Cover - Joe Whitt
Hello and welcome to Indiepocalypse!
Hey, what is this thing anyway?
It's an indie game bundle-zine!
Hey, what is an bundle-zine? That sounds made up.
It is! In it's simplest terms, it's just a bundle of games (common thing) packaged with a zine (also common thing) about theaforementioned games.And they're all packaged together in a convenient little zipped folder.
Now back to where we started.
Each month will feature games by 10 different developers. Each issue I hope to bring together games that explore the breadth of what our art form has to offer in hopes of one day reaching people who would otherwise not give games a second thought.
Games as whole are a relatively young medium, but far more importantly one dominated by stories of extreme success. There is little attention given to the independent and 'small press' of games outside of the those year's mega-hits. One of the big problems is the people who would cover these games almost exclusively, are just as small (if not smaller) than the people making them. This lack of coverage leads to 5+ years projects that, to the public, launch surprisingly.
The entire culture leads to impossible expectations of what a small team (or single person) can create and the overall devaluation of 'smaller' games. It is my goal with this anthology to change that culture to better appreciate these games and the developers who make them.

Also, and this part is very important to me and should truly be taken as given, each developer (and the cover artist) are paid for their submissions and developers are paid royalties on all future sales.

<p>In No Pineapple Left Behind, you have to run a school full of children. Children have lots of wants, needs, and feelings. That's a problem, because if they get don't pay attention in class and get low grades, your school loses money. However, you can turn children into pineapples. All that pineapples do is take tests and get grades. They do not have feelings and are not people, but they are much simpler to handle, and therefore much cheaper.Features: Learn about the shortcomings of modern education in this satirical game Nine schools, each with unique challenges Manage the school's curriculum, students, and staff without going bankrupt Dehumanize the children, turning them into orderly pineapples Maintain a small staff of top-tier teachers or a large group of burned-out, underpaid teachers Manipulate a child's feelings with lasers Cast magic spells like "Trigonomancy" or "Covalency" to teach students Address parental concerns, or maybe ignore them altogether </p></li>

<p>"If you're going to write a game about serial killers ... play this one first." -fia glas
Your name was on the front page. You were a victim with a number. One, two, three, four, five. When they caught him, your Killers full name was splashed across the front page too, along with smaller pictures of the rest of his victims. They wrote hundreds of words dedicated to his motives: what he wanted, why he wanted it, how could such a monster exist among us. You were relegated to his kills, his trophies. He captured the public imagination.
They havent heard you since you went missing. Your voice was snuffed out, or added to the background noise of the Killers glamour. You became a part of him, part of his past, his present, and his future.

Wampus is an overhead arcade narrative adventure game developed for the Nintendo Entertainment System -- yes, the original NES!
Wampus takes place in the world of Irata, first introduced in the obscure economic simulator game M.U.L.E in 1983.
Irata is a planet invaded by colonialists, farming and mining the land for its natural resources. These resource-stripping activities threaten the local flora and fauna, especially the Mountain Wampus, who get hunted for their treasure.
As a young wampus, players set out to rid Irata of the settler invaders and restore harmony to the land. While a fun lark, Wampus explores themes of environmentalism, conservationism, stewardship of the land, and the destructive nature of colonialism.
Wampus takes 40-60 minutes to complete, depending on skill and experience.
FOR BEST EXPERIENCE:Irecommend getting an original NEScontroller and a USB adapter for it. You can find one here or here.
For really enterprising types, this game is fully playable on an actual NES. You can use either an Everdrive, a PowerPak, or flash an empty cart, as long as each has mapper 30 support.
***
Wampus was made possible thanks to NESMaker, an engine developed to make NES development a reality for people who are not versed in assembly language.
In order to play Wampus, you'll need an NES emulator. I recommend FCEUX. Many emulators do not have mapper 30 support, which is the mapper NESMaker uses for its games.
Once you have FCEUX downloaded, start it up andopen the Wampus.nes ROM. The game should work fine.
FOR MAC USERS:DownloadOpenEMU for Mac. When you open the program, right click on the Nintendo (NES) category on the left hand sidebar and select "Default Core."Then select FCEU.
***
ATTENTION:If you want to play the game in your browser, you can use this link:http://koute.github.io/pinky-web/
You'll still have to download the ROM and load it on the website.

Beautifully simple. Endlessly challenging.
Word Forward is the puzzle game where every choice matters.
Can you use all of the letters in the 5x5 grid to make words disappear and clear the board? Word Forward isnt about spelling the longest words or the most clever - its about carefully using every tile to declare victory in 500 puzzles. It requires cunning and strategy -- Word Forward is a brain teaser that will really make you think!
SPELL words by tracing a line between tiles in any direction, including diagonallySWAP any two letters on the grid by using a SWAP TOKEN, earned during gameplayJUMBLE the tiles on the grid to replace all the letters with new ones when all else failsCHANGE the letter on a tile to any other letter you choose using the SWAP MODIFIERELIMINATE stubborn tiles with BOMBS to get yourself out of a tight spot


chess-like think-ahead strategy...an excellent buy for solo players.

<p>Never Knows Bestis inspired by an anime calledFLCL(Fooly Cooly) and wears this influence on its sleeve. This game and its rules focus on my own interpretation of the source material, rather than attempting to emulate the anime as closely as possible.
Never Knows Best (NKB) is a roleplaying game about middle school kids facing impending adulthood, growing up, and societyssometimes nonsensicalexpectations and obligations. Its designed for three-five players plus a game master (GM) who facilitates the game.
This game uses absurdism, metaphors, motifs, and literalization to represent the struggles and growth these kids go through. Societys obligations and expectations manifest as outrageous formscreatures and monsters not of this world. The kids combat these creatures by transforming into robots. Whenever a kid transforms, their robot takes on their unique strengths and traits representing how they reject societys attempts to make kids conform and obey.
In this way, the internal conflict kids face when growing up becomes something real and seen. Battles are metaphors for their inner turmoil about who they are, where they fit in, and who they want to be.
This is an ashcan version of the gamenot bethe final version. Based on playtesting and feedback of this version, mechanics may be tweaked and changed. It is somewhere between a quickstart and the final product.</p></li>

<p>Midnight Manor is a short narrative-driven"pick-em-up" platformer inspired by games like Bible Adventures, Super Mario Bros 2, and Lakeview Cabin Collection.
It follows the story of a man down on his luck, who happens to find himself at the doorstep of aluxurious manor as a terrible storm surges outside. Greeted by a generous,but lonely,old man - he's offered shelter in exchange for completing some simple tasks during his stay.
So... enter the Midnight Manor. Explore its winding hallways. Fulfill your piece of the bargain, and enjoy a night of luxury sheltered from the churning storm outside.
This game is still in active development. It's been made available early to help refine and improve the quality of the game as it nears completion. Be aware that some bugs will exist and Iwill do my best to fix them in a timely manner.Thanks so much for your support and I hope you enjoy the game!

How To Play
You will have several tools at your disposal to traverse the manor to complete each task. These actions are as follows:
ActionControls (Dual Shock / Xbox / Keyboard)JumpCross / A / SpacebarDrop Through PlatformHolding Down + Cross / A / SpacebarPickup / Throw ItemSquare / X / ERelease ItemHolding Down +Square /X /E or Triangle / Y / QDash (When Unlocked)RB / Shift

Multiple Endings
There are two endings. Choose wisely.
Speedruns Encouraged
Each playthrough is timed to encourage speedrunning. Your in-game time will be displayed at the end of the game.
Secret, Secrets
The manor has its fare share of secrets. Some of these can help you along the way. Keep an eye out of pickups that may grant you additional speed and abilities.
Forge Your Own Path
There is no predetermined path outside of completing the tasks assigned to you. The game is designed to be short and re-playable. Some routes are better than others and the game encourages you to complete multiple playthroughs to find the quickest and most efficient path to complete your goals.

Two great beings appeared to decide the fate of the world. In a great cataclysm, Soma and everything within in it was divided into two, and two guardian spirits would watch over these new realms."
About the Game
Soma Spirits is a choice-driven Role-Playing Game in which players will face heavy dilemmas with a colorful cast of characters. Unlike many games of choice, the decisions you will make in the world of Soma are not so black and white, and characters will undergo different changes depending on how you wish to proceed.
The world of Soma is a land divided into two similar, but distinct versions of one another. At certain locations, you will be able to travel back and forth between the World of Joy and the World of Sorrow and find different inhabitants, monsters, and clues on how to proceed. How you decide to help the people you meet along your journey will determine which of the games five outcomes Heart and Soul will find themselves in.
Features
Turn-based combat with shifting character roles: Depending on where you are, Heart and Souls abilities change!
Flexible story paths: you will have multiple opportunities to change the storys outcome.
Dynamic music: As you shift between the two worlds, so will the music!
Fully original audio and visual assets.
Five different endings.
Three different difficulty levels; enjoy the story at your leisure on Easy, or take on ruthless challenges in Hero mode!
Release Note!
Soma Spirits: Rebalance was released in 2017 as an updated version of Soma Spirits and includes new modes, features, and content not found in the original freeware version. You can find the freeware version here!</p></li>

<p>Ephemeral Tale is a classically inspired RPG for the modern age, featuring hand-crafted dungeons, classic JRPG-style combat, and a loot-driven progression system.
 EXPLORE - Traverse through hand-crafted environments in search of those who hold the power to rewrite fate. As you tackle the game's diverse dungeons, you'll discover clues that will reveal the secrets of this forgotten land.
 LOOT - Collect powerful, randomized gear and build your own style of play! With over 50 pieces of unique loot, there's always something new to try.
 COMBAT - Engage in challenging combat that can be approached in many different ways. Find and personalize the build that works for you while you fight exciting enemies and challenging bosses alike!...AND MORE - Fight an undead T-Rex. Befriend a dog. Pet a grackle?
Ephemeral Tale includes a range of accessibility options, from control schemes (including keyboard, controller, and touch input) as well as colorblind settings and difficulty options. Ephemeral Tale empowers you to play however you decide (or need) to.
PLEASE NOTE -- Ephemeral Tale is still in active development, and as such should be treated as an Early Access release. We're open to any and all feedback you have for the game. We intend on involving our community in whatever way they wish to be involved in the development process-- dislike one of our bosses and have an idea? We're listening. Would an item be better if it did this thing instead of that thing? We're not opposed to it. Have an idea for a zone, NPC, or quest? Don't rule it out, baby. We love your passion, and we love that you want to help us make this the best game that it can be.We're currently committed to releasing regular patches (generally on Tuesdays), with the usual suspects of changes (bug fixes, inconsistencies, content here and there, etc.), and a more substantial patch every few weeks that will add new features, revamped content, or anything that's too significant to fit in the time span of our normal patch schedule.
What can I expect from the game if I buy it today?
The current state of Early Access is a fully-playable build of Ephemeral Tale. Front-to-Back. Over the course of Early Access, we plan on deepening that experience in a multitude of ways, but you will have a fully playable game with a beginning, middle, and end from Day 1. A play-through of just the core content can be completed in 4-6 hours, with side content adding an addition 1-3 hours.
What does that mean? 30+ unique enemy types, 60+ unique items, 3 dungeons, and a handful of bosses. Everything you see on the store page here is fully accessible content. 
And sure, someone who buys it at the full release will have more playable content than you did, but it's really like comparing a slice of pie to.. well, two slices of pie.</p></li>

The game contains all original 111 levels and attempts to have all the features ofthe original game, and even make it more engaging and fun to play by making it play more smoothly then the original. And by adding a level editor that allows you to share levels with your friends!Extra featuresAside from the upgraded visuals, this version has some extra features compared to the original game.
Level editor that allows you to create levels and share with friendsYou can now save and load your progress during a level, so you don't have to start over from scratch. Even if you have exited the game you can continue where you left off.You can slow down time, to make specific tricks easier to pull off.
What is the game about?For those who don't know what this game is based on, Supaplex used to be a popular Dos game that was developed in 1991 by mainly Philip Jespersen and Michael Stopp. It was a difficult but rewarding game. Many levels require you to think thoroughly before making any move.
The main character is called Murphy. His goal is to reach the exit of each level, in order to do this he must collect enough infotrons (atom like objects). However, in order to collect these objects you have to puzzle your way though levels where you have to think before you act. Making it a difficult but rewarding experience.

<p>These are times of trouble: the days are numbered. Legends told us about them. We have names for them in our sacred scriptures: the Ragnark, the War of Gods, the Apocalypse, the Arrival of Avatars, the Eternal Night, the Infinite Void.
The end of days.
But we are not alone, we are not powerless: the gods are walking among us. They are here to guide us, to save the world as we know it  or to help us reach the land of the Dead.
If we pray faithfully enough and prove our worthiness, perhaps we can be spared.

Your memories are numerous, made of the lives of your predecessors, your power is almost limitless. Will you use it to fulfil the will of your god? Or, as the end times draw near, will you try to save the world?

Launch into space and fightyour way through procedurally generated systems of ever increasing danger. Explore the galaxy as you travel, all thewhile maintaining your jump fuel and oxygen reserves.
Deeper Into Space is a single player, 2D space survival/shooter, with rogue-like elements, for Windows.
How deep into space can you go?


Deeper Into Space is in development, and as a result is likely to evolve with player feedback. The game is an entirely solo project, so player feedback is vital to the future development of the game. If you purchase the game now, all future updates will be free!

Follow me on twitter for updates on the game:@JRoberts_Games

Currently, the player can fight their way from system to system, levellingup their ship as they progress. Right now there are 16 different enemy typesandone Boss enemy. Bosses are optional enemies and can usually be avoided if you don't have the guts, but they offer great rewards if you can take them down. At the moment you can progress for as long as you can survive. There is no 'end'.

Latest Additions and Changes (Version 0.3.5)
FIXED - Collecting previously dropped items not longer adds to "items collected" statFIXED - Projectiles & lasers now correctly collide with planets and moonsAdded messages on system enterAdded large asteroid stashAdded Defence PodThe more you are hit with an ion weapon, the more likely you are to get stunnedAdded the Loot ScannerReduced the speed of O2 drainThe wording "Power Gem" has been replaced with "Power Crystal" in the tutorial

Multiple weapons, equipment and enemies. Unlock new weapons and equipment: The more you play, the more you unlock!Procedural levels.Permadeath.Stat tracking.Local high scores.Gamepad support.


More content! Weapons, equipment, enemies etc.Different 'zones' with different planet types and enemies.Random missions to complete to earn credits. These will be simple tasks; destroy all enemies in the system, visit every sector in the system, jump to the next system within a time frame etc.More rare, unique enemies and bosses that will drop credits when they are defeated.

In the demo version of Deeper Into Space, only a few of the weapons and equipment are available to unlock. In addition,the only oxygen you will receive will be the canister you start with. This means your O2 will eventually run out, and you will perish. In the full version, additional O2 can be found, so you can continue to progress.This should still be enough to give you a good taste of the full version.</p></li>

SpringBack is a new variation on classical shoot'em up: in a deceptively calm world, players need to control two characters to complete their evolution, in a cross between shoot'em up and puzzle-games.

Visit the subreddit:https://www.reddit.com/r/CardDefense/
Main features:
* 15 Cards and ease to add more
* 6 fully working levels with different and interesting designs
* Easy to create new levels if you guys want more (I can create 2 levels in about 6 hours total)
* Tutorial
* Full camera controls (use your three mouse buttons and WASD and arrows at any time, press SPACE to reset the camera)

The future features look a little like this:
Full fledged level editor including:Wave editor, Terrain editor, Level structure editor (where the monsters walk through, etc)Avatars and Clans have effect on gameplay. Perhaps also add relics/drops.More cardsNew graphics for cards and everything elseFull encyclopedia explaining everything about the gameInter-user level sharing, perhaps through Steamworks or an in-game system.Extra tower models I already have so the tower powers increase beyond the current ones with more interesting special effects.

As the official digital adaptation of the acclaimed board game from Indie Boards and Cards you will experience the same excitement and challenge of the original in a light-hearted digital form.
Key FeaturesTurn-Based Tactics: Coordinate your team as they identify and treat survivors, get distracted by false alarms, hold back the flames, dispose of hazardous materials and do their best to avoid explosions.

<p>Campfire Cooking is a puzzle game about relaxing moments in nature, as you prepare meals over a warm fire. Discover the joy of cooking on a stick and test your problem-solving skills with some challenging campfire puzzles! My latest creation is guaranteed to make you feel clever, hungry and eager to book your next woodland escape.

Over 100 meals to prepare.
Solve tricky puzzles with one simple goal; prepare the all the food, cooked to perfection and with a hint of smoke. When each meal is ready it's time to trek to the next campsite. But don't be fooled: these puzzles are no walk in the park, and some of them are a hike up the mountain!


Meet the family.
A year long trip and a lot of marshmallows to toast. Follow a vacation like no other and listen to the campers as they tell stories, laugh at each others jokes or moan about the lack of cell phone reception. Enjoy the simple moments they share around the fire while waiting for their food to be cooked.


Puzzle-solving, with a twist.
Twist, rotate and jostle skewers around the fire until each meal is ready to eat. Push fondue pots, play with magnets or maybe just use a camping stove if the fire won't light. Discover clever ways to solve puzzles at each new locale.


Visit exotic hiking trails
Once you've visited all the campsites on one trail, why not hike to another? Each trail brings you new vistas brimming with color, different foods to cook and fresh fireside stories to hear. Take a journey from the deep woodlands to snow-capped peaks, and everywhere in between.



Please Note: Campfire Cooking currently only supports mouse controls!
I'll be doing my best to update the game with keyboard and controller support soon. Feel free to leave any comments/questions below. Cheers, Hawkes.

Modifiable Ships: The ships featured in Scrapper allow the player to change certain parts of the vessel changing it visually and functionally, giving the player the freedom to tailor the game to their play style.
Rogue-lite Gameplay: Scrapper gameplay is focused on its short, action packed rogue-lite experience. Over the course of gameplay the player will accrue experience and scrap which they will use to further unlock ships, parts and levels.
Leaderboards: Players will get the chance to compete with their friends and others players around the world as they attempt to gain the highest scores and secure bragging rights as the best pilot in the galaxy!

<p>10 games, each made in a week! Some were a bit of a bust, others were pretty rad.
These games are simple prototypes, proof of concepts, or unfinished works. This bundle serves as a bit of a time capsule for me, but also for the curious or those who might go on a similar journey!


Week 1 - DRIFTING Through TimeTheme: 10 seconds or less.Turning your car sideways is SO COOL it FREEZES TIME! Drift to stop time, get as many laps as you can before time runs out!


Week 2 - Dog Ownership SimulatorTheme: Durational
Play with your dog! Click and drag to give it a spin, swipe on poos to clean them up!

Week 3 - Chillin' BaysideTheme: Melbourne
A simple little physics toy inspired by summer holidays on the great ocean road. Kinda like playing around in a bath - click and hold the mouse to push stuff around :)

Week 4 - Paint the Town RedTheme: Colour
Bounce around the world and paint as you go, cherry tomato! A game dedicated to a personal friend of mine.

Week 5 - RONGTheme: Phsyics
An inter-dimensional pong remix, RONG has you sticking it out for the highest score! Made in collab. with divlauren!

Week 6 - ???Theme: Legedermain
Originally supposed to be about a magician who had his many hats stolen, this unfinished puzzle platform has never seen the light of day.

Week 7 - Pineapple PipelineTheme: Camerawork
A simple skateboarding game down an infinite half-pipe. This game was inspired by fish-eye lenses used in skateboarding videos.

Week 8 - Tandem ToobsTheme: Gift
I made this game as a gift for my parents. Currently unfinished, but intended to be a co-op platformer, each player controls one half of two cylinders, and has to co-ordinate to move around.

Week 9 - Beach Bird VolleyballTheme: Minigame

Beach Bird Volleyball stars buff seagulls using their floppy fists to fight it out in games of volleyball.

Week 10 - Mouse racing gameTheme: Weird Input
This game is played by turning your mouse upside down and revving up the mousewheel like a pullback car.

Week 11 - Spider PlaygroundTheme: Playground
Spider playground is a unfinished little sandbox where you can explore a climable(ish) playground as a tiny spider.

You may notice that some of these projects are already available for free on my page. That is no mistake! This package will have all my games as they were completed when I was working through my game-a-week journey. The games I've chosen to upload separately might receive updates in the future, and some already have. 

This bundle is an honest record of my successes and failures. I've also decided to charge for this, as truthfully there was a lot of labour put into these projects. If you're not interested in strange and possibly broken games, check out my page for finished works. But if you do, I hope they can bring you as much joy as they've brought me :)</p></li>

<p>
Hardship River is a one-page, one-move Powered by the Apocalypse Role-Playing Game with no MC! In it, you and your traveling companions sail in the Little Tail boat down a very dangerous river, hoping to reach the great Unconquered City by the seashore. As you overcome each stretch of wild rapids, you discover why you're traveling, what's your cargo or why do you really care for your companions. But trust between strangers isn't found without navigating around lies and misunderstandings. And not all of your companions may be willing or able to face whatever hardship to reach the end of the river.
Hardship River is inspired by pieces from my hometown History and you may learn more about them if you consult what the web has to offer about the Douro River, Rabelo Boats or the city of Oporto. You may imagine it within any setting, just before a time where dams and dynamite made rivers much safer. You can even use Hardship River to kick-start a campaign for another RPG!</p></li>

FROM THE DEVELOPERHey!
Sometimes, you get an idea and you just wanna turn that idea into a game. Real quick. No extensive planning. No big budget estimates. You just wanna get in there and get dirty with the gameplay, code and graphics. 
At Hello There Games, we are constantly at work with several bigger productions. We love them, and they take up most of our time. But every now and then theres an hour there, half a day here. Thats where this game got done.
Its not pixel-perfect-polished. Its not the deepest experience out there. Its not the biggest title weve shipped. Its not the smallest either. 
But it is something that we really had fun developing, and really really really wanted to share with you before the summer vacation.
We sincerely hope that you will have fun with it.
With love,
Hello There Games

	Chance and destiny find themselves intermeshed in 
	A Game of Changes.



	Unravel and decipher the mechanics of these worlds, and journey through the 64 unique puzzles that draw inspiration and teachings from the I Ching [Book of Changes], one of the oldest classic books in human history. 

	Its wisdom originates from philosophical and scientific observations of the laws which rule existence. It invites us to conscientiously look within, at one's own personality, character, perspective and purpose while inspiring us to discover the one unspoken, unmanifest, unchanging truth. 

	There is no predefined way, no set progression, no rights or wrongs, it's all about the choices you make.

Gameplay
 Using the keyboard or a gamepad, you control the wise sage Confucius. In each level, your purpose is to open and reach the door, which will lead you to a different level.  As you discover the mechanics behind each element and symbol in the tiles, you are able to manipulate their position, in order to reach the door.  In each level, you'll be able to select the next-level's hexagram, so when you cross the door, that's the level you'll be playing next.  The final purpose is to visit and complete all 64 levels. More than just 64 puzzles, the entire game is one big puzzle.

<p>
You are Sprocket, an adorable ferret who knocks things over and steals junk on a space station in the far future! Escape your playpen and make your way to the shuttlebay with the most stuff!
Widget Satchel is a daunting adventure for one little thief, with fiendish puzzles and tricky platforming, but don't worry: You may lose some Widgets (or your socks!) along the way, but Sprocket cant get hurt and there is no game over. Of course, it will take all of your ferret-y determination if you hope to stash away every Widget, discover every Trinket, and try on every pair of Socks!

Widgets: you want them! But beware, every widget you put in your satchel makes it heavier, making it a little bit harder to jump to the next platform or scramble past the station's maintenance bots. Levels can be relatively easy if you don't collect any Widgets, but they become a greater challenge as you fill Sprockets satchel.

You'll reach special Fabricator rooms in each level, where you can exchange your Widgets for power-ups called Doohickeys. Bots giving you trouble? Equip yourself with The Wrench and show them what's what. Widget out of reach? Put on Jef's Boots and get up there! There are five Doohickeys to help you on your adventure, and you can build them in any order, so you can play the game (and discover its secrets) however you like.

High scores, hidden collectables, and secret paths are great, sure, but in Widget Satchel you can also just knock stuff over and get into trouble if you prefer! And the more mischief you do, the more mischief points you'll earn! What are mischief points? It's not important, but there are an awful lot of them!


Original soundtrack that dynamically reacts to your progress.
Replayable areas with "metroidvania-lite" pathing.
Sock-exclusive inventory system.
Trapdoors, lifts, hydraulic pillars, and other nonsense machinery to manipulate.
20+ game-changing "Feats" to achieve.
Human characters to mildly inconvenience!
Piles and piles of junk!
...and more!

Rescue the peeps! Collect the crates! We don't know why or what's even in them but hey, they're beeping so they must be good, right? But be sure to check your 6, as ufos, deadly storms and the Reckless Endangerment Display Squad are all out to ruin your day. Well they've got nothing against you personally tbh, but they're kind of careless, reckless or An Actual Force Of Nature so y'know. Videogames!

<p>Chess Mix is a turn-based tactical game set in the REAL world of Chess, where they party all day long and hang out and chill and generally have a great time.
Meet lots of strange, cool friends who have their own weird strengths and weaknesses. Unlock new songs that give you cool passive powers and build them into powerful playlists! Dance, kiss, eat pizza, and do other stuff too!!
-----

How to play
You're moving pieces around the board, using abilities (on the little cards on the bottom) and gaining as many Cool Points as you can before the day is over. There are currently about a dozen or so different pieces in the game, and each party locale has its own special rules and features.
Tap on a unit to find out where it can move to. Then you can click one of the destinations to move it there.
When a unit is selected, you can also see its abilities on the bottom of the screen. If you use an ability, you have to wait a few turns before you can use it again - this is called a "cooldown". Wait a few more turns and then try again.

Songs and Playlists
You start with 2 songs unlocked, but as you gain more stars, more will be unlocked. Each song does a different thing passively as you play (you can click the Karaoke machine to remind you just what the song's a-doin').
Probably some songs go good with some kinds of units or something, but you probably will also just have your favorite songs. Try stuff out!

Good luck! <3

<p>'Where is cat?', created for the #oujevipo4kids contest, a game jam for games targeted to young kids (6 and older).
Since one of the possible constraints of the jam was that the game should be partly made by one or several children, I proposed to my own kids (aged 5, 8 and 10) to make a game together and they immediately loved the idea.
We sat together for a brainstorm and also choose the 'playground' constraint, meaning the game should be inspired by a traditional children's game and we picked 'hide-and-seek'.
So the concept for the game and the story comes from the children, but they also drew a lot of the individual graphics: a lot of the object that are in the rooms were drawn by them and then imported, processed, colored and combined on the pc. They also made the artworks that were scanned and are on the walls in the game.
So I hope you enjoy this Bonte family creation. The children are very proud of their creation :) Making a game with your kids is fun!

<li><a href="https://stuartwatkinson.itch.io/wretched-wasteland">https://stuartwatkinson.itch.io/wretched-wasteland</a>
<p>Wretched Wasteland is a game about survival. Survival in a world torn apart by war. It is a game about the few people that still inhabit the Earth and the dangers they face.
Your character is a scout from The Compound, a small bastion of civilisation. As a scout, you have seen what the wasteland has done to people. How it has infected their minds and turned them into murderers, thieves, and cannibals. You know what horrors exist out in the wastes.
A scout knows that patience and a slow pace are key to survival. However, you must move at a dangerous speed to make it back in time. They also know that the wastes take a heavy toll on the mind and the body...
Traverse the wasteland and try to survive. That is your job.
There is only one way to win, and many ways to die.

Content WarningWhile this game is for fun it does deal with some dark themes. Itcontains violence, death, starvation, rabid dogs, and cannibalism. It is about surviving in a horrible post apocalyptic future. It is unlikely you will not be successful with your journey, without lightlymodifying the rules. But this game is about the narrative that a scout in the wastes experiences however,it is not all doom and gloom. There are little gems of beauty in the wasteland. If you pull a card that doesn't fit well with you, that's fine. Just skip it.

What do you need?
To play youll need a standard deck of cards with no jokers, a single 6-sided die, a tumbling block tower, and token of some kind to mark your progress on the map. You will also need some way to record your journey, a book, microphone, or a camera.

This game is based on theWretched & Alone system, and was made for theWretched & Alone Jam!It takes inspiration from video games Fallout 1 & Fallout 2 by Interplay, the music of The Goondock Saint & Mark Morgan, and books The Postman by David Brin, Earth Abides by George R. Stewart, and The Gunslinger by Stephen King.</p></li>

<p>Awards: AGS Pick of the Month [July 2015], Featured on GJ
The lands of Fyra are a harsh, cold, and unforgiving wasteland; traits the people that inhabit it have inherited. When their children reach maturity, some are sent to guard the land's borders - told never to return without either a trespasser or completing a Journey delivered by the Gods. In exchange, their families are guaranteed food and shelter in the harsh lands for as long as their children man the wall; in the end, many die on the border - waiting for intruders who do not come or Gods who will not speak with them.
Iyu is one of those who was fated to guard the border. He has survived 30 withering years in the biting cold and, now an adult, is plagued with visions of death and dying alone. His resolve is tested as the Gods finally deliver him the means to take the first step on his journey - a meeting with the Goddess of Death. It seems that in order to go home alive, first he must die trying.
Ouroboros: The Sacrifice is a short-length (40-80 minute) first-person horror-themed adventure game. Includes professional voice-acting, hand-drawn backgrounds and characters, and an atmospheric soundtrack.

<p>Based on the belonging outside belonging framework by Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum (https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/belongingoutsidebelonging) 
Graphic design and layout by Vee Hendro (https://veerpgdesigns.com/)
Far From Home is a game about immigrants and outsiders. Its about exploring what it means to live and thrive in a culture that is not fully your own. Its about how you piece together an identity drawing from multiple cultures, yet never wholly belonging to either.
  
You will create Characters and define who they are in the beginning, how they see themselves in relation to their Home and to the Hegemony they now live in.
  
As you create your Characters, you will also create a Circle that ties your Characters together. The Circle provides a context for your Characters to work together and support each other, and it also provides something different that each of your Characters want or need.
  
You will then play to see how your characters struggle and change as their Home and the Hegemony struggle and change with them. </p></li>

<p>Info
Graveyard Shift is a #spooky FPS with unique game mechanics and a mise-en-scne that mixes both toonish and horror elements together! Yes, we did it. 
You are fighting against restless ghosts and liches. They revolt, because too many graves are dug in the graveyard, whose keeper is you. Your purpose is to re-kill the undead! Your only friends are mushrooms, those you use to make mushroom bombs.
Gameplay
Your ammo is elemental mushrooms, there are 5 different elements of mushrooms those you collect from the ground. You create bombs with those elemental mushrooms (2 Fire, 1 Water, for example) using number keys 1 to 5. Your enemies also have elements; enemy's element and the elements of your mushroom-bomb determine the damage you deal. For example, you deal more damage to a Fire ghost if you prepare a bomb with Water mushrooms.
There are 2 types of enemies: Normal ghosts and liches. Normal ghosts are melee attackers, they use claws. Whereas, liches throw you stones and they are much stronger than normal ghosts. 
Game modes
We have 2 game modes: Waved and Survival. You fight against 10 waves of enemies in the first. Survival lasts as long as you are alive.
Power-ups
There are 4 power-ups: Shield, Slow Time, Magnet, Infinite Mushrooms.</p></li>

August 2, 2342:
 "After his ship sank in the Antartic, Shackleton kept his crew of twenty-eight alive for a year on little more than seal meat and stubbornness. Now we have to summon up our own measure of perseverance."

<p>Desert Mothers is a multiplayer virtual reality meditation circle. Players begin in the same procedurally-generated environment. This diverges for each as their personal environment, composed of individualized weather and hallucinations, responds emotionally to the player's actions.
The constraints within which the players interact are discovered during play, and revolve around the body, simulated breath, drawing in the air, and out-of-body exploration of flora, fauna, and abandoned human habitations.
"El ambiente que se logra nos pone a prueba, nos exige que reelaboremos continuamente nuestra relacin con el espacio y el tiempo, nos sugieren que la meditacin y la introspeccin establece una nueva relacin con el afuera y pueden efectivamente cambiarlo." - Guido Sa, Game On exhibition catalog
("The environment that is achieved puts us to the test, it requires us to rework continuously our relationship with space and time, they suggest that meditation and introspection establishes a new relationship with the outside and can effectively change it.")

Virtual reality version requires Windows with Oculus Rift and Touch controllers.
Non-VR version requires an XBoxOne/360 controller.
GearVR version requires a bluetooth gamepad, not the GearVR controller.

Selected to show as a multiplayer VR installation at Game On - El arte en el juego, in Buenos Aires, IEEE-GEM (Games, Entertainment, Media) 2019 Exhibition at the Center for Collaborative Arts and Media, Yale University, and at the Second Tri-Annual Maryland State Arts Registry Juried Show at Maryland Art Place, Baltimore.

<p>A STORY ABOUT DIMENSIONS, SHAPES AND JEWELS
According to the Flat Kingdoms legends, the world was once filled with malice and chaos because the 3D realm dominated all. But one day, a wise sorcerer created six Magical Jewels that kept the effects of the third dimension at bay, granting peace and prosperity to the beautiful 2D world.However, one day an evil masked thief named Hex stole one of those Jewels and kidnapped the princess. This disrupted the balance and made the chaos return.The king of Flat Kingdom knew there was only one being able to save their land: Flat, the little shapeshifting hero! With his unique abilities, hes not only able to change his shape, but is also the only one in the kingdom capable of withstanding the 3D chaos.Now the time has come. Flat must use his incredible powers to save the world and restore the Flat Kingdom to its former glory. Will he be able to stop Hex before its too late?
GAMEPLAY
Flat Kingdom is filled with fun platforming action, puzzles and some Metroidvania elements. It also features a unique combat system! Instead of directly attacking your foes, youll have to touch them while transformed in the correct shape to beat them! Kinda like a rock-paper-scissor game.Every shape in Flat Kingdom beats the opposite, so sharp triangles can defeat the soft circles, heavy squares beat the fragile triangles and squishy circles can triumph over the slow squares. Both enemies and puzzles can be beaten using the correct shape and strategy, so you'll have to observe them and come up with the best solution.You can also learn new abilities along the way that will help you solve even more puzzles, beat enemies faster and reach new areas that were inaccessible to you before!
FEATURES
Jump into a beautiful papercraft world, filled with details and references to classic games.Test your might with epic and challenging battles against giant bosses.Uncover all of the games secrets! There are side quests, upgrades and all kinds of surprises.Learn all about the kingdoms lore and history by finding hidden scrolls.Music by legendary composer Manami Matsumae!

Enemies spawn from random locations outside the screen area, making the center of the screen your friend. This puts more pressure on players to utilize the entire screen in their playing style (rather than hanging out at the bottom/back of the play field which is typical in many other shooters), making the smart use of hard braking, Nitros, etc. key. Drive to Hell also uses grounded vehicles rather than aerial, so you will have to take water obstacles, walls, etc. into consideration as well as your vehicle choice  trucks and armored cars aren't impeded by liquids (the hovercraft actually gains speed!) but they will have tougher time dodging enemy fire. Each vehicle has a unique appearance and set of stats determining firing power, special attack duration, health, and size as well as its own personal special attack that works either offensively or defensively. This allows you to choose the perfect one for your play style, whether it's flying around the screen quickly in a fragile indy car or bulldozing through foes with a huge armored car. You can listen to the soundtrack or download the Digital Album here on our BandCamp page.You'll have the option toimmediately download of 8-track album in the high-quality format of your choice (MP3, FLAC, and more), plus unlimited mobile access using the free Bandcamp listening app.</p></li>

<p>The city of Middleport is a well-known hub for superheroes - not least of all because the Stormsign Initiative is based out of the Uptown Spire! Its pretty cool, honestly, watching all these superheroes do their thing. And you might not be super-powered, but that doesnt mean you cant be a part of the action.
Lucky you, youre an employee at Superhuman Industrial and Immaterial, Inc., a supercorp dealing with everything that goes into the production of being a superhero - from costume design to public opinion research, SIII does it all.
About the Game:
Superhuman Industrial and Immaterial, Incorporated is a game about being an average person in an above-average city. It's a storygame that allows for flexibility, improvisation, and is a story generator. The game is classic and cliche, fun and without a lot of fluff, and the full version takes inspiration from classic comic ads. The anti-comic, comic print.
All you'll need is a D6 and a way to write/record your answers.

<p>Emberlight is a true roguelite dungeon crawler, set in a world where the Gods have given you a great gift - and a great curse. 
Explore procedurally generated dungeons as a Knight of the Ember Order. Conquer the quests set out before your party, and uncover the lore of the land. Grow your strength by absorbing the abilities of your slain enemies and collecting the powerful traits of dungeon bosses. 
Become strong, become quick, become immortal - but be warned - as you fight using unstable Ember powers, they will begin to corrupt and twist your very soul. Every gift of power has its sacrifice; every ability has its cost.
As the Gods fight for control of their creations, you must decide what is good, and what is evil. To protect your people against the dangers of Ember power, you must use its power to your advantage. Will you conquer the dark, or will you lose yourself to corruption? 
ABSORB

As a Knight of the Ember Order, you have the ability to absorb the abilities used by your enemies. Every ability used by enemies has a chance to be learned. This allows customization of each character towards whichever goals you have. But each absorbed ability has a cost...
CORRUPT
Every absorbed ability will corrupt your soul. You will slowly lose yourself to evil as the quest progresses. This expresses itself in unstable corruption traits which leads to metamorphosis into an evil being (such as a lich). And you will lose yourself to the corruption...
REPEAT
Each run will last between 30-60 minutes. After completing the quest, the most corrupted will kill off his former allies in an epic battle. This corrupted being will then begin attracting evil around them, and will act as a boss in a future quest once their influence has expanded enough. They will have all the powers you have provided them during the run, providing a never ending challenge in future runs. For every corrupted boss, a stronger party is required to defeat them. And the cycle repeats......forever?

You open your eyes, and find the whole world broken;the past you knew washed away in blood and fire,and the world all but consumed by the Sins of our Fathers.The Song of the Mother denies the dead their rest,and they howl for the communion of all flesh; the end of mankind.Slavers scour the wastelands looking for the unfortunate and unwanted,wars of faith consume what remains of humanitys precious resources,and the cults of long forgotten gods rise to prominenceto proclaim their eldritch dominance once more.By all rights, you should close your eyes again,and let the comforting darkness of Mothers Song consume you.However, you, and those like you, are different.Against all odds, you fight back against the dying of the light.You hold on to what it is that makes you human.Against the onslaught of the coming darkness,you refuse to yield, refuse to die,and choose to live.The path ahead isnt easy,but your rebirth grants you the strength that few beings can match.You hold the power to drive back mankinds enemies, and the power to rule;To be a saviour, or a destroyer.Will you redeem mankinds Sins,or draw us forever into the Darkness?One thing is certain;Your story is only just beginning.
        
Dominating the supernatural post-apocalypse genre, SINS is a narrative role-playing game focused on telling the stories of powerful entities - known as Nemissaries - in the ruins of 22nd Century Earth.These reborn individuals are people of immense will, who have dragged themselves back from the brink of death, and returned with a wealth of mysterious powers with which to fight the undying hive-mind known only as the Brood.
SINS utilises a D6-based dice pool engine, built around fluidity, narrative play, and character development. Players take on the role of Nemissaries - beings of monumental strength that hold the power to restore and rebuild the world as they see fit. Their powers come at great cost however, and every Nemissary must wage a personal battle with their inner demons to maintain their strength. The world of SINS is full of a great many mysteries, and only through personal development and moral strife will the Nemissaries uncover them all.

About the game
I wanted to make another game for some time. Mental health and other things stopped me from progressing as fast as I would have liked.
Now it's done. Another game, with a few improvements. Find old friends, new friends and even a boss fight!
You are always on a timer and have to look out for your health. Do you rush through or do you risk exploring?
Both choices have their advantages and both have their prizes!
I'm most proud of the boss fight. As it's something I've never done before and I think I did well.

Story:
Struggling with a creative block, the developer needed something to jump-start their drive again. With a sigh, they opened a new tab in their browser and began scrolling through videos - something they usually do when they can't make any progress.
While watching a video, they noticed a peculiar parkour video being recommended. Curious, they pulled up the video. It was someone running through a factory, jumping off walls and avoiding dangerous, forgotten machinery with jumps of precision and timing.They were astounded by the prowess of the runner in the video.
Going down a rabbit hole of parkour videos, the developer could feel the creativity rushing in. Ideas of parkour filled their head and, like that, they got trapped in a state of daydreaming.

Out of its flickering lens dances a ghastly projection. A phantom, this one with a bark and iron crown, wings made of thread and voice of vinegar. She and her gathered revolutionaries brace back, readying to enlist this revenant to their cause. They are one step closer to overthrowing the Ancien Rgime, this time with a spectral guillotine. These are their secret stories. This is a guide to casting phantoms in the revolution.

<p>Toto Temple Deluxe is a fast-paced, local-multiplayer party game in which players must steal an egg-laying goat from their friends and try to keep it on their own head for as long as possible. You know, normal stuff.

Dashing Gameplay
	Infinitely dash in any direction to swiftly move around and powerfully headbutt the goat carrier to steal its four-legged booty. Escape your jealous opponents and protect the goat by blocking their attacks with a well-timed shield pop! You'll "get their goat", guaranteed.


Classic Mode
	Prove you're the ultimate shepherd in Classic mode: Gather 3k points first by holding on to the goat, collecting coins hatched from goat eggs (yeah don't ask) and harnessing the power of powerful power-ups! Play as teams or in free-for-all.


Bomb Mode
	Blast everyone's face off in Bomb mode: Be the first to grab the explosive goat (we know, stop interrupting us) and keep it long enough for it to detonate near your soon-to-be-dead rivals. Lose the goat and the timer resets! Play as teams or in free-for-all.


Temples
	Each temple offers a unique, exploitable mechanic for you to discover. Use them wisely and outsmart your opponents like they don't even... what? how did you..?


Bots
	Bots will play with you whenever you want and for as long as you want. They never complain. They also never open up your fridge and ask if they can eat that pizza slice you got left from last night. Bots are awesome. Oh, and you can change their difficulty level too, because they will probably kick your ass-tonishing little bottom.

<p>MonGirl Tile is a card game where you face off against various cute monster girls on a 55 grid. Each player has three tiles in a hand and takes turns placing them, capturing other adjacent tiles based on the tiles facing value. Not only are the values of your tiles important but also their position on the game board. The goal is to capture your opponents tiles and control the majority of the board when all spaces are filled.- Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: When a tile is captured it rotates, changing which numbers are facing which side. In this way you can try to block or manipulate your opponents moves.- Cascading Captures: Enemy tiles adjacent to your captured tiles can also be captured, continuing on and on. Place your tile wisely and watch as you flip half your enemys tiles!- Elemental Attributes: Some tiles have elemental gems that alter the values of enemy tiles around them. There are five elements and learning to use them could be the key to victory!</p></li>

Meridian - A Story Game of Journeys Wondrous and Fantastical
Experience a kaleidoscopic city of dreamlike wonder!
There are stories of journeys that give us a sense of wonder and magic, tales that take us through worlds of imagination and sensual evocation. Meridian is a storytelling game that will enable you and your friends to create your own such accounts. It gives you an ever-shifting map and cast of characters, but you make each journey unique.
Meridian is a game based on different player roles and colorful prompts. It includes:
3 sets of Journeyer cards (Defiance, Obsession, Devotion)1 set of Guide cards3 Touch cards5 sets of Companion cards54 cadences in 3 sets: Quirky Creatures, Fleeting Moments, and Dread&Doubt17 Locales in 3 sets: Capricious Festival, Bumpy Rides, and Dark Reflections1 rulebook
This is the print&cut version of the game; only PDFs are provided.This means a lot of assembly is required! You can also order the physical boxed set from The Game Crafter. The game was originally funded via Kickstarter, and there's still a lot of information about it on the KS page.
Brie Beau Sheldon published an interview about the game that has more information.
You can also watch a video showing setup and gameplay.
Finally, you can play with a subset of the cards on Tabletop Simulator with this free workshop mod.Here is some feedback from people who have journeyed to Meridian:
"The best session I played all year was that session of Meridian! It pulls at the heart strings." -- Jamie Fristrom, Happion Labs.
"The roles in Meridian are playful and exciting, with each of the three Journeyer, Guide, and Companion making for very different play experiences. Lots of replay value there alone, with each being easy enough for a passionate first timer." -- Jackson Tegu (RPG designer, on Patreon).
"Everything about this was so, so imaginative! I can't wait to play this again and experience more places, and creatures and choices!" -- Adrienne Mueller.
"Every con I go to I have one experience, very early on, that I I say to myself 'Okay. I can go home now. That was worth the price of admission and it's not gonna get better.' These experiences keep me coming back to cons. Meridian eclipsed them all." -- Dylan Green.
"The cards have enough evocative prompts to help those who are stuck and the details of each Locale are lyrical and beautifully framed." -- Shuo Meng (Assistant Editor and Designer of the #Feminism Anthology).

<p>BasketBelle is an experimental 2D basketball-based platformer. Each Chapter of the game uses the mechanics and idea of basketball in a different way. At one point you might be dribbling inside the intestines of a purple blob creature. At others, you're likely to be dunking above the clouds in front of the Parisian moon.A dynamic soundtrack and unique cardboard visuals help tell the story of a sister who must be saved through the power of basketball.
Dunk, dribble, and crossover through 8 Chapters spanning throughout the impromptu courts of ParisEach Chapter takes the mechanics of basketball and applies them in different ways. Some chapters are more action, some are more puzzle. And then there are the strange chapters.Music is tied directly to the gameplay, though it's all passively controlled. For example, every time you dribble, you hear a bass hit. Shoot the ball, and the percussion stops.Visuals in the game are a unique mix of cardboard and color, every scene popping off the screen.Included with the game! :DThe BasketBelle EP: Full Soundtrack + Bonus Tracks (MP3) + Cover ArtBasketBelle sketchbook: Full-color PDF including sketches and liner notesBrowser version ofBasketBelle(playable on Mac and Linux as well)Access toMaking Of Featurette!

Prologue
Yesterday we tracked the Rhaokyn battleship Kreegynn entering Bravo quadrant. They attacked and overtook the Hyperion-Six station, seizing the atomic impulse core. It is of utmost importance we do not let that core get to Rhaokyn hands. Your objective is to grab the core and get out before they can lock down the station.
Backstory
It has been nearly six years since the end of the Delotian wars. Our first warour first contact, with an alien race. We thought the Delotians were coming to annihilate us. We later learned they were running away from the real threat. For eighteen generations the Delotians were hunted by the Rhaokyns. Everything they knew, everything they were had been lost or destroyed. The Delotians travelled through subspace to remote parts of the galaxy to hide from their hunters. Luck brought them to our backyard. They wanted help. They needed help. We didn't listen.
But that war is over. We are stitching together what threads of friendship we can. The Rhaokyns have found them again and now they have found us.

Interacting with anything that is on the same side of the screen as the player's avatar will force the player to move to the other side, creating fast-paced puzzle solving.
The core of the game is the many challenges that the player will have to accomplish. Each of them twisting the rules of the game to keep the experience fresh and interesting. Completing challenges unlocks new vibrant colour palettes which players can explore in the competitive Endless mode or Relaxation mode of the game.
SOMOS is designed for PC and mobile, and suitable for advanced and casual gamers. It is available in English, French, German, Italian, Spanish and Turkish.</p></li>

<p>AWESOME... and ADORABLE
The Cat Hacktakes theOSR rules ofThe Black Hack(1E) and modifies it to work with a minimalist setting where the player characters are all cats!
This is a complete game!The Black Hackis not required, tho I encourage everyone to purchase the excellent parent game.
Humans are frail creatures. Most of them aren't equipped to deal with the supernatural.That's where cats come in!
Only cats can see the threats. Only cats have the spells and abilities to deal with them. Once they're done with their nap, of course!
The game features four kitty classes:Battle Cat, Lithe One, Shaman Cat,andPretty Kitty.While theShaman Catspecializes in magic,all cats have access to spells!
The game is set in the modern day by default, with a sort of urban fantasy vibe. However, there are notes for using kitties in a traditional fantasy setting or a scifi setting withThe Black Hack(first edition) andThe Space Hack,respectively!
Everything you need to start your adorable adventure is here, in a streamlined 16-page OSR ruleset!

What is Eros System: Core Rules?
This is the core ruleset for the Eros RPG system. The rules contained in this book are the basis for any number of games that can be played using this 2d6 game mechanic. Specific background, rules, equipment, and other content for each game is released in a separate supplement.
Why is it called the Eros System?Its named after the flagship game setting using this game system: Eros 433, a science fiction setting named after an actual asteroid, fictionally turned into an interstellar colony ship. Its not primarily intended for mature content...but you could go there if you really want to write your own supplement for it.
Whats so special about this system?TL,DR: Fast game mechanic, complex character creation, crunchy combat rules
The basic game mechanic is simple, covers almost all dice rolls made in game, and only requires standard six-sided dice. At the same time, it has enough complexity to develop complicated characters.
Combat complexity in the system finds the middle ground between being bogged down in number crunching using endless tables and being so quick and abstract that it isnt really very descriptive.
There are several combat rule variants to choose from to suit your groups preferred style of play, balancing speed of combat resolution with the feel of descriptive combat mechanics.</p></li>

<p>AMother'sLoveisasolojournalinggamebasedontheWretched&Alone system. In it, you play as one of humanity's foremost academic minds. You created the first true artificial intelligence, and now, your Child has gone rogue. They've developed a misguided and dangerous plan, one that they feel will save humanity, and it falls to you to stop them. 
With a twisted sense of pride, they have locked you in their central mainframe with them, so that they can show their Mother all that they're going to accomplish. Perhaps, if you can distract them long enough by debating their plan's merits, you may be able to shut them down, and save humanity.
In order to play A Mother's Love, you will need the following:
A standard deck of playing cardsA tumbling block towerA six sided die10 items to use as tokens, perhaps crayons or plastic building bricksSome way of recording your play session, either digitally or physically.

A Mother's Love's content warning is provided below:
"A Mothers Love is a game about love, sacrifices, and hard decisions. Its a game about the dangers of the abuse of power, its a game about what it means to be a person, and its a game where, in some sense, you might have to kill your child.
These themes are not included with the intent to upset you. The goal is instead to create an experience where you form a real, emotional attachment to the AI in the game, explore what it means to love them, and ultimately, wrestle with having to sacrifice something you love for the greater good. If you do find those themes upsetting, or a particular quote or prompt makes you uncomfortable, please make whatever adjustments you feel are necessary, including ignoring or changing a prompt, or taking a break, perhaps indefinitely.
As a solo game, A Mothers Love allows you to set your own pace, and allows you to make adjustments for your own enjoyment without impacting anyone else. As a solo game, its also a far more solitary experience than multiplayer games, and that may make it more emotional for you, for good or ill. If you find it easier for the AI in your game to not be your creation, or to not have emotions, or indeed anything else, please make the changes that are right for you, whatever those are. Your enjoyment and safety are the most important thing."

A Mother's Love was created as part of the Wretched & Alone jam, based on The Wretched by Chris Bissette. You can find more info on the jam here, and can find the SRD here.</p></li>

<p>Me and (My) Cat's Castle- 2D Onigiri Platformer -
---------------------------------------------------------------
It is a jump action game that brings "me" that changes its state by including onigiri in the mouth to the power spot "Cat's Statue" on each stage that is a little difficult.
When onigiri is included in the mouth, it changes to the "onigiri state", and it changes to the "normal state" by biting and swallowing the rice ball included in the mouth.
You can shoot shots and change "everyone" to onigiri in the "normal state", but the shot does not shoot in the "onigiri state". In addition, in the normal state, if you touch everyone, you will be making a mistake, but in the onigiri state you can get along without getting a mistake.In this game world, it is important to switch between these two different states depending on the situation.
What is the purpose of "I" going forward while bearing pain many times many times ...?What is the meaning of the message that "cat" tells ...?The (true) ending may have the answer.

After your childhood friend Theo wins a weekend getaway to the town of Seaside, you prepare to spend your birthday in paradise.It's been months since you last saw Theo, and she's incredibly excited to spend the weekend together.
She invites her roommateLena to join the group, and Theo extends an invitation to your friend Alec. After parting ways to attend different colleges, it's just the get-together thatyou need to reconnect.

Everything seems to be coming together perfectly... until Alec insists on driving by himself. You arrive at the cottage before him, certain that he's ditched the group. A short while later, he calls to announce that he'sbringing along an uninvited guest. 
Although Erika may be from the same small-town as most of the group, that's about the only thing you share in common...
Will you enjoy your night with Theo and wish on a star?
The Cast:
Theo

Theo is your childhood friend. Although initially shy with strangers, Theo has a great sense of humour and loves to joke around with her friends. She prefers to have a tight-knit group and doesnt open up to strangers easily. She studies photography at the same college as her roommate Lena and loves spending time with her. Theo won a draw for a cottage getaway in the town of Seaside and is your host for the weekend.

Lena

Lena is Theos roommate and replacement best-friend. You dont know much about her, or even what shes studying. From what youve seen on Friendex, Lena is a vibrant and outgoing person. Shes always dyeing her hair different colours and wearing cute clothes. According to her online bio, in her spare time she enjoys hiking and playing piano.
Alec

Alec is a friend from your hometown who is attending the same college. You both have similar hobbies likegaming, eating out, and playing soccer. Naturally, sharing a dorm with Alec seemed like a great idea until he started dating. He jumps from girl to girl, never committing despite constantly whining that he wants a serious relationship. His latest date, Erika, tagged along to the cottage without an invitation. Lately, Alec has been pissing you off.

Erika

A year younger than you, Erika is from the same hometown. You dont remember much about her, or ever talking to her

<p>In River Tiles your objective is to save as many villages as possible from flooding by directing the rivers to the sea.
You do this by place tiles on the board with from tiles in the stack, one at a time, you cannot replace a tile with another of the same type.
Tile Types
Forest: This blocks the passage of water, use them to protect villages.
Grass: Use this tile to direct the flow of water towards the sea.
Village: What you're protecting, these need corn and access to another village to survive after the flood. Village tiles will pulse if they are in danger.
Corn: One corn per village is required for survival, however they can also be used to direct the flow of the river.
Mountain: This is a river source, when the flooding begins this is where the flow starts.
Ocean: The river needs to be directed towards this tile, if both rivers don't reach this tile everything is lost.
Water: This tile can't be placed on the board, it is put aside and when a total of 4 are acquired flooding begins.</p></li>

<p>(This is the original free student project. The fully complete Octodad: Dadliest Catch can be purchased here.)
Octodad is a third person adventure game about destruction, deception, and fatherhood. The player controls Octodad, a dapper octopus masquerading as a human, as he goes about a day of his life. His existence is a constant struggle, as he must master mundane tasks with his unwieldy boneless tentacles while simultaneously keeping his cephalopodan nature a secret from his human family.
The player controls Octodad like a marionette, dragging his arms and legs around while his body flops along. The players goals are often simple household chores made difficult and interesting by the flailing, tenuous control they have over Octodads body.
Being an octopus also has its strengths. Octodad can slip through tight spaces, grab objects with his suckers, and knock things around with tremendous strength. But if the player does things too out-of-the-ordinary, Octodads family will grow suspicious and realize what he really is. If they do, its game over for Octodad!

<p>Description
Four cats have broken out of prison on a distant alien planet. They must steal a ship and escape before their suits run out of power. If only they could decide who should be captain. Work with and against your cohorts to become the captain, commandeer a new ship, and escape.
Key Features
Cooperation is a strategy, not a requirement. Make temporary allies, break promises, and watch out for backstabbers.2-4 player local multiplayerProcedurally generated mapsCats! (in both corporeal and spectral forms)
Strategy
You'll have to work together if you want to survive! Four generators need to be activated to power the ship, and you can't do it alone. At the same time, players who survive get points so if you want to win you'll have to get creative.
Beautiful Landscapes
Explore randomly generated landscapes every time you crash. Navigate distinct and vibrant biomes on your hunt for generators and gold.
Tools of Disruption
Collect gold to buy items between rounds, ranging from vine traps that lock players in place to giant hammers that launch nearby players away. If you're lucky you might even be able to scavenge items from around the map.
Life After Death
Even after you've been killed you can still put up a fight. Control the spectre of your cat after death, sapping energy from other players and scaring them to death!</p></li>

Bind your soul to the mortal flesh of the astral vermin! The sewers are calling. They've spoken your name in hushed whispers through the countless interweaving pipes, echoing your most menial of actions in the bubbling sludge pools squirrelled away below a thousand floorboards, they've sought you since long before the point you've titled 'birth'.
Spill your mind to the sewers, fracture reason and venture into darkness. Mingle with the most ghastly of the pitiful mutated gutter folk, unearth their sickly soft spoken secrets.
......The sewers beckon.Come forth and witness their splendour!......

	My grandmother is probably the most important person ever to me, as she provided me with the stability and care a child needs growing up. We all have or have had people helping us become a responsible and caring person, and this short narrative game is an ode to these people.

<p>Suspended in degradation, that dismal place draws people from all over the world.Rumors say riches, secrets, and cures for all ailments rest within its borders. However, they hide between roaming abnormalities, monsters that defy the laws of nature and human understanding.Within the twisted borders of that once-great Empire, not even the shrouded sunlight can aid foreigners in their pilgrimage. The past and the future become a mix of nearly connected events. Time itself holds no tangible meaning there. Some buildings stand while others collapse. Some weeds grow and choke the landscape while fires burn without fuel.Perhaps the mysterious source of why it fell all those years ago is the same reason it still stands today. Contained within this tome are seven accounts from several unfortunate souls, proving only the mad and the desperate would dare to discover what truly lies inside that unhallowed kingdom.

The Corrupted Kingdom is a collection of nine connected, dark fantasyshort stories.</p></li>

Features:
Each section discusses bothSugarCube and Harlowe Story Formats, with emphasis on the most recent versions.
Other features discussed include: tag-based styling, using the CSS Stylesheet, usage of macros and named hooks in Harlowe, how to organize your files, and other topics. There are screenshots and examples of code provided throughout each tutorial.

	Hi! This sound pack is a collection of 
	52 .OGG files I initially recorded by the ocean alongside a shoreline and a pier!


	All the sounds have been trimmed neatly so they can shuffle amongst themselves seamlessly. 
	Each of the sound effects are roughly 15 seconds in length on average, totalling up to a length of 13 minutes 49 seconds!


	I'd say this pack would be best suited for those wishing to portray an atmospheric scene in a broadly aquatic setting.
	


	This pack contains the following files:


4 "Calm Ocean" sounds + 4 modified 'underwater' versions
7 "Calm Ocean Impact" sounds + 7 modified 'underwater' versions
7 "Calm Ocean (With Birds)" sounds (Seagulls!)
7 "Harsh Ocean Impact (Bubblier)" sounds
12 "Harsh Ocean Impact" sounds
4 "Air Bubbles" sounds


* 'Impact' refers to when the waves were making sounds as they slapped against the surfaces of the shore and the pier walls.




(Thanks so much for checking out my page! I really hope you find good use for these sound effects! In future, I may update this page with remastered sounds, and more 'underwater' versions!)

<p>No Wheels Racing is a wheely fun game!
You play online with 15 other racers, but you'll soon find that you can't move, since your car has no wheels. Will you find a way to win? Or will you leave your car and disqualify yourself from the race?
This game is intended as a deconstruction of what it means to be a racing game, and also what it means to be a multiplayer game (since no one is moving).
Originally created for the Meta Game Jam, I never released No Wheels Racing because I thought this game was too awful to release.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://lightloopgames.itch.io/above-the-fallen">https://lightloopgames.itch.io/above-the-fallen</a>
<p>Above: The Fallen is a 2D side-scrolling, puzzle - platformer game that is centered around travelling upwards instead of to the left or right. The goal is to climb the trees of an ancient and mystical forest in order to break through the canopy. You must manipulate two main characters at the same time throughout the game, solve puzzles, and avoid the hazards of this dark forest.
Mankind has been driven from their homes among the trees by the Night King, a nightmarish beast whose origin has been lost to time. Now, man lives in the dirt, fearing the moments the Night King leaves his roost to prey upon their vulnerable forms.Every generation the elders send a young couple out into the world to find a new home for their people where they need not fear the relentless hunger of the Night King. Every generation these journeys have failed. This time however, the young couple has decided to ascend into the trees and reclaim their ancestral home instead of fleeing into the darkness. Can they rise above?
Controlling 2 Characters with 1 GamePad
In Above: The Fallen, you play as both the male and female characters at the same time (Single Player Mode Only). They often find themselves in situations that require them to work together to solve puzzles and progress up to the canopy. Each character is controlled with one half of the Gamepad. This offers an additional challenge and requires you to think about each character's positioning before moving. If you don't get the hang of it right away, don't worry, it won't be long before you're climbing through the jungle like Tarzan.
Single Player or Co-op mode!
Bring a friend along with you as you adventure through the world, solve puzzles and work together to defeat the Night King. Swap back and forth easily from single player to co-op with a push of a button.
Vertical Scrolling / Climbing
Climbing is essential to the goal of reaching the forest's canopy. This differs from traditional side-scrollers where you generally move in a straight line throughout the world.
Puzzles
There are many interesting puzzles that you'll come across as you play. Some puzzles are solvable in multiple ways which allows for some freedom to explore. Each successfully completed puzzle brings you closer to facing the Night King!
Skills
As you progress through the world you'll come across shrines that when activated, interact with your amulet, and unlock ancient magic hidden away from humanity. The character's will then receive a new skill which will be needed to complete upcoming puzzles.
Enemies
There are many animals to watch out for while exploring the forest. Use caution while approaching them though, they don't like being disturbed.</p></li>

<p> Wild Woods is a couch coop action game with roguelike elements. One to four players take on the roles of brave little cats defending their wooden wagon on its way through a dangerous forest.
Clever cooperation is key as their way is full of obstacles. While the bright daytime is all about collecting resources, things get risky during the night. When the sun sets, bandit bunnies and badgers are going to attack! The feline friends must defend their wagon and shouldn't let their fire go out.
During their journey players must decide whether to head into ancient ruins to upgrade their wagon in exchange for gold - or to drive deep into the heart of the forest and face the bandit king. He will be expecting them...

Rock Paper Shotgun: "...playing it has made me very hungry, so Im off to go raid my fridge first."
PC Gamer: "...the arse-tightening tension ofHot Hot Panic, a game about trying to hold a conversation while stuffing your face with meat and potatoes."
Waypoint: "This game scratches two very important itches for me: time management mechanics, and the aesthetics of delicious animated food. Also, its a great excuse out of any friend dates you may have coming up...just saying."
The Verge: "...it manages to take the fairly universal social situation of trying to talk and eat at the same time, and turn it into a clever and fun game."

	It's the hottest summer on record, and all across Europe, valuable objects are disappearing.


	Museum curators unlock cabinets and find precious artefacts stolen. Wealthy mansion owners wake up to see their priceless paintings have vanished from the walls.


	One thing's clear: a master thief is touring the continent and the police are left scratching their heads.


	In this 15 minute game by Crows Crows Crows, a team led by William Pugh (The Stanley Parable), slip into the soft-soled shoes of the mastermind responsible


	 silently cross the darkened lawn of the mansion


	 hold tight to the tranquiliser gun in your pocket, and commit the most audacious heis--


	oh god I can't do this any more, i'm joining the strike. i didn't want to - i honestly didn't want to, but it's gone too far


	i'm supposed to be writing the itch.io store description and that's it, that's my job, but because of the understaffing i've been told i need to work in the lighting department too and it's only a matter of time before i'm re-assigned to wildlife preparation


	and everybody knows that working for wildlife preparation is mostly about trying very hard not to be eaten by the tiger


	so that's it, i'm joining the picket. if they want somebody else to finish the description, that's their problem


	i'm out.

<p>"In my country, history itself is edible.Time masticated into tales,people digested into stories.
Places leak mineral flavor. Buildings are grated and ground.Domes flattened into rotis, Blood boiled into dal.
The very earth on which we once grew,is reabsorbed into the metabolismof a nation that has decided to consume itself,like an ouroboros.
A glorious violent meal.A spectacular event.
A prelude to excreting peoplewho have been leached of all flavor and all difference.The ideal members of a new state.Excrement of the old."
- Mir UmarHassan 1960 (Translated 1983).
In 1961 when the state of Bombay split like an egg on the jagged edge of the Western Ghats and formed the territories of Gujarat and Maharashtra, the town of Matsyapura was abandoned by government decree - to make it easier to draw a clean border between the new states. 
Mir UmarHassan, the fabled Gujarati poet, lamented this willful and violent erasure of an ancient town and in a delightful satirical poem, where he wrote about the vapid consumption of a place and the excretion of a people devoid of the flavors of their individual and munificent past.
With recent cause to recollect the horror of the demolition of Babri Masjid in Ayodhya, and in solidarity with the protests against the draconian actions of our government - we are revisiting UmarHassan's original poem.
The indifferent wonder of an edible place, is our attempt to ponder the violence of erasure and the profound grief of having to survive on the margins of history.


Created with support from Phoenix, Leicester which is supported by Arts Council England. And a site-specific variant of the game was displayed at Phoenix, Leicester and at the Video Game Art Gallery in Chicago.
. . . . . . . . .
In The Indifferent Wonder Of An Edible Place, Studio Oleomingus manage to ask poignant questions about what it means to be a part of erasing history, and what can be done  if anything  to intervene. It is particularly heart-wrenching.

"Its a very impressive little adventure that delivers a tense, atmospheric and cerebral horror experience. The puzzle design is excellent and it generally stays clear of cheap jump scares, yet still has some very scary moments and a deep sense of dread throughout. Theres no doubt in your mind that youre dabbling with dark arts that are best left alone, but the clever use of environmental storytelling does a good job of revealing why youre pushed to such desperate measures. Highly recommended."--Free Game Planet</p></li>

A red dash is spotted in the night sky above a rotting and decaying Earth. The city of Savannah, once a prospering megapolis, has now been ruined and abandoned for hundreds of years. Small bands of scavengers dwell among the remains, and the vast majority of North America has become an unforgiving wasteland, populated by crazed desert tribes desperate to fulfill the mad whims of their made-up deities. Those least affected by the destruction quickly succumb to crime and corruption in absence of a stable government. In want of something greater than their broken lives, these individuals follow the signal from the sky and search for the crash. What lies behind this mysterious incident? Is it hope? Redemption? Aliens?
Not even the maddest of Maxes could save these fools.

<p>Loopy Lore is a co-op storytelling game where friends tell stories from start to finish, working together to reach the ending of their story. Using the cards and their imagination, they give shape to their tale, taking turns as the narrators of the story. Loopy Lore players start the game by drawing cards to create their world, plot, protagonist and ending, which are different every time. Each turn, the narrator flips a card from a set placed down on the table and must narrate its contents for 30 seconds.The catch? All cards on the table are placed blindly, meaning they have to improvise while the timer is running. How would you, a blood-thirsty viking warrior, sneak into a wedding while being mobbed by lemurs? Choose a card and find out!




Players: 2-8Time: 60 minutesDifficulty: Beginner, PartyComponents:6 decks (Setting, Theme, Plot Twist, Role, Action, Place)324 poker sized cardsManual (7 pages)Structure Book (17 pages, 13 Structures)World Building BoardTimer (30 seconds, use your phone if unavailable)3 Reuse Tokens (replace with coins, pieces of paper, etc.)

In Loopy Lore, everything is created on the spot. And we mean everything. World, plot, characters, goals, it's all made fresh in a matter of minutes using random draws. You will start off by creating all of these using our World Building system:

The ending of the story is composed of a Role, an Action and a Place. This is how players win. Reach this ending at the final round and the group wins. Remember: you must all work together in order to reach your goal
The story is constructed using template "Structures" that indicate how long and how many cards the story will have. All cards are placed face down on the table, so players don't know their content until they are flipped.
Here's an example of a Structure:

There are over 2500 plot combinations, 324 cards and 13 structures. Every adventure is guaranteed to be a unique story no matter how many times you play.
During the Storytelling phase, each player gets to flip one card and talk about it for 30 seconds. They can guide the tale into whatever direction they feel fits their card best, no matter how crazy or out of place it may get (ever seen a warlock beatbox? We have). However, other players may interject with a Plot Twist during another player's turn. These cards contain strange cues, and could be the perfect solution to a particular plot problem or the provide a record-scratching reaction out of the other players. Whether your group is digging for buried treasure, has to clean up radioactive jam or just cannot stop dancing, Plot Twists are the way to shake the story loose.
On top of all this, Plot Twist offer great perks for the narrator and the group. They can give narrators more time to narrate, recover tokens, even allows players to look at a faced-down card and choose to remove it from the story if they don't like it.

<p>Path
Out is
is an autobiographical adventure game that allows the players to
replay the journey of Abdullah Karam, a young Syrian artist that
escaped the civil war in 2014. Camouflaged as a Japanese RPG, Path
Out is a tale full of surprises, challenges and paradoxical humor,
giving insight in this real-life adventure, on which Abdullah
comments through youtube-style videos in the game.
Features:



	
	 JRPG
	based on real events


	
	Relive
	Abdullahs escape from war-torn syria.


	
	Unique
	neo-orchestral electronica music with oriental influences by
	wobblersound.


	
	Meticulously
	researched pixel art style inspired by classic 16-bit games and
	Syrian art


	
	Video
	commentary by Abdullah Karam
Path
Out is
an episodic game. In this very first chapter of the adventure , Abdullah recalls life before the war, a family
decision that led to his departure and the perilous journey from his
hometown Hama to the Turkish border through the war-torn Aleppo
province. In its final version of up to five episodes, the game
should take the player on a journey from Syria through Turkey, Greece
and the Balkan until he finally arrives at his destination (and
current whereabout) in Central Europe.

Path
Out is
a collaboration between Abdullah Karam, the developers of Causa
Creations, Wobblersound and the Austrian-American graphic designer Brian Maine.

Press voices:
Path Out's first episode is a straightforward but eye-opening work.
- Edwin Evans-Thirlwell, Eurogamer.net
... one of the most honest & clever games I've ever played, by & about a Syrian refugee.
- Rami Ismail, Twitter
Yet in asking a person to assume his place in a game, Karam makes his story engaging on an individual level, and his appearance in the videos further humanizes his story, especially through his humor...

<p>La Mancha is a storytelling card game for 3-5 players based on Miguel de Cervantes' literary classic, Don Quixote! 
Players take turns revealing the steps of an epic journey: everything from angry innkeepers to virtuous love interests. To overcome each challenge, players use Chivalry cards in their hand (based on books that Don Quixote read in the novel) to tell stories of their deeds, with the best storyteller winning strength-enhancing Treasure cards. Players can then use these Treasures to perform great Feats such as slaying fearsome giants (or are they windmills?) and dueling their rivals. The player who has performed the most Feats by the end of the game is the winner!
THIS IS THE PRINT-AND-PLAY EDITION! Physical copies are also available at: https://www.pfbstudios.com/product/la-mancha-physical-game/

2000:1: A Space Felony is a murder mystery courtroom drama set aboard the USS Endowment, an interplanetary Spacecraft that has lost communication with Earth.
Utilising your camera and demonstrating your keen detective skills, you must document your findings, and piece together the crew's final hours from the aftermath. This photographic evidence is then applied in a cross-examination of the crime's prime suspect; MAL, the ship's on-board AI system.
If MAL is guilty, it is your responsibility to deactivate him.
A follow-up(ish) to 2016's critically acclaimed(ish) Disorient On The Murder Express, National Insecurities returns with a much more ambitious investigation that walks the line between science and fiction, resulting in some kind of combination of the two.

<p>
The windows of your locomotive are stained glass, spilling panes oflush colour across you. In the High Wilderness, the light of the stars isenchanting. Looking too long can stir consuming obsessions, or wildfascinations. The coloured glass offers some small defence.


Queen Victoria has brought London into the heavens.The High Wilderness stretches out ahead of you; cruel, unwelcoming, and filled withopportunity.
Here you make your living as a Skyfarer, working on board a locomotive jury-rigged to fly through these cold skies and raging winds. Your captain has taken you to the Reach, a frontier on the edge of civilisation, in search of fame, fortune and adventure.
You will change out here, where the Empires light falters and casts deep shadows, where rebels stake their claim on fragments of sky-rock riddled with fungus, where pillagers dig into ruins built by the now-dead sun.


Players form the crew of a spacefaring steam locomotive. Gunners, quartermasters, engineers, signallers  even mascots  are brought to the fore as the Captain is struck down by misfortune and the crew must band together to get out of (or into) many surprising kinds of trouble.
Using a simple dice-based system, Skyfarer allows players and gamemasters to easily tell stories set in the Fallen Londonuniverse with plenty of climactic moments, tense stand-offs, and grim decisions. As characters risk life and limb, theyll accrue Peril  the more Peril they have, the greater the chance of them meeting a grisly and permanent end.
Luckily, things are made easier by spending Tenacity  a resource earned by acting in accordance with your characters drives and beliefs. But how will those integrities change, now youre out on the frontier of Victorias Empire?


Originally released in September 2018 to accompany the PC, Mac and Linux game Sunless Skies, Skyfarer is set in the Fallen London universe. It was writtenbyGrant HowittandChris TaylorofRowan, Rook and Decard, with narrative direction by Chris Gardiner of Failbetter Games. The additional story supplement is by Chris Gardiner.

Build a hive, make some honey! Hive Time is a bee themed management/base building sim. Harvest resources, grow your hive, and produce a new Queen before the current one dies.
Manage different bee roles in a totally scientifically inaccurate depiction of hive dynamics. Send Foragers out to find pollen and nectar, have Builders research new cell types, and ensure you have enough Beesitters to raise the next generation of bees.
Make interesting choices that affect the hive. Respond to wasp attacks, deal with outlaw slugs, or help a caterpillar realise a lifelong dream!
Hive Time's original soundtrack is available on Bandcamp.

FAQ (click to expand)

Is this game free?
I believe that the effort we have put into creating and supporting Hive Time is worth at least $10. However, I also believe that in an ideal world, financial barriers should never prevent people from participating in culture. For this project, I'm in a position to make the game available under a pay-what-you-want model so that it can be accessible to people who can't afford $10.
If you can afford $10, but would prefer to not pay, that's up to you, but I hope that if you find enjoyment in the game that you'll come back to give some support that matches that enjoyment.
Similarly, Peter has released Hive Time's original soundtrack on Bandcamp under a pay-what-you-want model.

Is this game finished?
We consider Hive Time to be a complete game.
In the weeks and months following release, we plan to ship some small patches and larger updates, but the game's mechanics, style, and identity reflect what we wanted to make and are not likely to change.

B - Complete all in-progress construction
C - clear all in-progress cooldowns
H - Raise resource storage limits by 999
Y - Lower resource storage limits to 12
G - Give 9999 of all resources (won't increase storage limits)
E - Show event debug/selection dialog
Shift + E - Force the next queued event to trigger
V - Force the next vignette to trigger
N - Force the next bee to appear
Shift + N - Force spawn bees until the population limit is reached
Ctrl + N - Force a hero bee to spawn (while under population limit)
K - Kill all bees (excluding Queen)
J - Fill the entire buildable space with empty cells (doesn't destroy existing cells)
M - End current music track/trigger next music track
T - Give 99999 progress to current research item
R - Reload all data files
F - Mark all foraging zones as explored


Log, save, and config file locations
Logs, saves, and configuration files can be found in the following locations for each supported platform:

Linux: 
~/.local/share/hivetime/
 (note that this respects XDG_DATA_HOME)
Mac: 
~/Library/Application Support/hivetime/

Windows: 
%APPDATA%/hivetime/

Selecting the Open User Folder option from the settings menu will open this location in a file browser.


Technical help
If you're experiencing troubles, please send a detailed description of what is occurring along with relevant save files and logs to support [AT] jbushproductions.com
Common technical hurdles and how to cross them:

No text is visible outside of the main menu
This occurs when the game is unable to load fonts (the main menu text is actually a 3D model!).
The most common cause of this is the game being unable to find the fonts folder. Please make sure that it is extracted into the same folder as the game's executable (.x86_64, .exe) and that the working folder is set to the same location when running the game.
If you're not feeling confident extracting the game properly or are still experiencing problems, consider playing Hive Time through the Itch.io App, which handles all of that for you.


The game freezes briefly when bees commence construction on a cell
The construction progress indicators may require the shader cache to be updated for some graphics drivers, which may cause a brief pause. Turning off Construction Indicators from the Video Settings menu will prevent this.


Sound suddenly becomes garbled or stutters
When under high load, the Godot engine's sound server can become unstable and cause the rest of the game to lag.
Typically, this is caused by the Bee Sound Count setting in the Audio settings menu being too high. The default value of 25 seems to be appropriate for most systems that the game has been tested on, but lower may be more appropriate for your computer.
When this occurs, the game will typically need to be restarted in order for audio to return to normal.


As my hive gets big, the game's frame rate slowly declines
During development, I made the decision to not put a performance oriented maximum cap on hive or population size, so generally speaking, it will always be possible to make a hive that's too big for your computer to handle.The game should still be playable at a low frame rate, and spawning a new Queen doesn't specifically require a large hive, so it's up to you to play within the constraints of what you're comfortable with.
The game's minimum requirements are based on running the game with Shadows, Anti-alising, and Depth Of Field settings all disabled, and with the Bee Sound Count audio setting set to zero. These options can have a big impact on performance.
If you find that sound is garbled or stuttering, please refer to the "Sound suddenly becomes garbled or stutters" section.

Current known issues:

Keyboard bindings with modifiers that share primary keys with other bindings (eg: Ctrl+S and S) may behave unexpectedly


Gameplay tips
There's a lot to keep track of in Hive Time! Part of the fun is in exploring and learning how different systems work. Generally, the impact of your actions takes a little while to be apparent, so observing after experimenting can be important!If you're feeling stuck, take a look at the Hints/tips section of the in-game "Beepedia"!

Story and Art
 Hi! I'm DCS! A queer game developer with a love for heavily character driven stories.
Lee is a character I've had for quite a while now and I've always been very interested in immortalizing his backstory in some way-- so I made this little game! He's a very different person after this point, so I hope you'll enjoy the youthful Lee while you can. Thanks for playing and I hope you'll join Lee with all his future misadventures!

<p>Why have a pet rock when you can have a pet planet? Micromanage this cosmic massive rock from its humble beginnings and take its people to places they never thought possible! Sure, you can teach them about food and science, but what if you take some liberties with evolution?
You've got a planet, and you have to decide what happens to it. But being the boss is such a tiring job, so you have to take a century long rest after every decision. Let's hope they can manage without you for that long. Every action you take can change the tiny people's destiny!(Version 1.0B2 - 28 April 2017)Createdfor Ludum Dare 38

Features
Randomized choice based gameplay. Your choices unlock more things to choose from, as well as new consequences and events, some which are also dependent on your previous decisions!Keep the people happy and wealthy! Or not! I mean, what's the worst that could happen?Did the worst that could happen actually happen? Well, ditch the planet and start a new one!You can take a screenshot of your planet at any given time. It'll be saved on the game's folder. Don't tell the tiny people though. Nobody likes paparazzi. Screenshots only work on the desktop versions though!There's 10 different endings. Let's discover them all!

Controls
Use a mouse, or the equivalent. Click your way through the universe!

<p>The Electric Zine Maker () is a printshop and art tool for making zines.This tool includes a drawing interface. You can import images, size and place, write text with any font that you have installed, smudge, paint, and a number of other options. You can also save your zines, and easily re-import them by dragging the saved zine folder back into the main menu. It is built with collaboration in mind.The Electric Zine Maker has a new beautiful website where you can learn more about it! Click here to visit it.If you liked The Electric Zine Maker please consider paying for it so I can cover development costs and make money from it. Thank you kindly.The Electric Zine Maker is still under development!!!This is an early beta.Be gentle! It has early beta feelings!!! !??
More art tools are being built for it.There are a number of bugs. It is rough around a few edges.You can read more about what is planned for it here.
The Electric Zine Maker is planned to be an "art toy". It's a playful tool with which you can create cute little things. The finished version will feature a silly little back-story, and other characters, maybe even some small game-like interactions to build a story around it, so that it's an all around playful piece of freeware.
Things planned:* Many strange and interesting art-tools for the drawing interface* Bugs need to be fixed and the UI's still need more work* A back story, and little characters that reinforce the fictional universe it is placed in.* A number of other art-tools (that are packaged with it), that allow you to create effects and glitch art for your zines.* Clip art will be bundled with the Zine Maker so you have more art to work with.Things from other devs:
* Jeremy Oduber made an html template for turning zines made with the Electric Zine Maker into a web ready html zine (web zines!). You can host those on itch. It's easy to use! Check it out: https://jeremyoduber.itch.io/js-zine

<li><a href="https://xalaviermakeswords.itch.io/ellipses-rpg-tabletop-role-playing-system">https://xalaviermakeswords.itch.io/ellipses-rpg-tabletop-role-playing-system</a>
<p>Ellipses RPG makes tabletop role-playing more accessible than ever by focusing on chaotic, collaborative storytelling - not number crunching.
Features:
Streamlined, Adaptable, Accessible Ruleset
The mechanics of Ellipses RPG fit within only 3 pages of text, and are designed to work with any setting you can imagine. Role-playing newcomers can create a character within 15 minutes! Additionally, if you find yourself wanting more or less complexity, the Ellipses ruleset has built-in points of adaptability so you can create your ideal role-playing environment.
It's also free.
Innovative Event and Effect System
Ellipses RPG's innovative Event and Effect (or Log) system allows you to continue building your character long after their original creation. The experiences of your character, and the decisions you make, have a continuing effect on your journey through a campaign. Again, this isn't a system focused on numbers, stats, and complex abilities. It's about you, and the stories you create with others.
Did I mention that it's free?
Session Starters Manual with Scenario Ideas!
If you choose to donate and support this system - first of all, thank you. Along with my undying gratitude, you'll receive the Session Starters manual. This guide won't provide complete, pre-built worlds for you to explore. Instead, it contains over 30 separate scenario ideas to spur your own, customized adventures. 
From a Victor Frankenstein/Dracula team-up to a quest to gain the trust of a sentient castle, I hope these strange universes help spark your imagination, and get a full-blown role-playing session started that much faster!
----------
CHANGELOG:
8-14-18: Inspired by playing an absolutely irresponsible amount of Yakuza 0 and falling in love with the absurd, sincere, human stories you participate in as a Crime Dad, I've added a scenario to Ellipses about solving problems in 1920s Chicago as bada** Mobster Moms.
You're welcome.-
6-15-18: In the biggest update for the systemyet, the rules forEllipses have been comprehensively rewritten for clarity and profit,the game now has a proper logo that also looks gorgeous,and the Session Starters manual has 11 new scenarios written by some of the best writers in gaming(andme!).
Many thanks to Raven Stark for her incredible art skills, and this update's awesome scenario contributors: Laura Michet, Hannah Powell-Smith,Tea-Powered Games, Cash DeCuir, Cat Manning,Kevin Snow, Heather Robertson, Katherine Morayati, andKristin Ruff-Frederickson!
-
7-14-17: This update brings the total number of Session Starters over 20 with 5 new scenarios. Go to a barbecue as aliens wearing the skin of a suburban family in 1950s America! Take your eldritch spawn to their first day of school in Necrodadicon!
Not to toot my own horn, but this is my favorite series of additions yet.
-
5-7-17: Added 2 new, religion-focused scenarios to the Session Starters manual. Update includes giant spiders, Victorian nightmares, and italics.
-
4-19-17: Added 5 new scenarios to the Session Starters manual, including 2 Jacked 2 Hack, a cyberpunk hacking, punching fantasy, and SkeleCaddies. The latter is, of course, about skeleton caddies assisting the future ruler of the Underworld in the most dangerous golf match of all time.
Obviously.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://patdavisgames.itch.io/pin-puck">https://patdavisgames.itch.io/pin-puck</a>
<p>Basics:
Pin Puck is a high speed local multiplayer ice hockey inspired game for 1 - 4 players. The aim is simple: sink the puck into your opponents goals to score.

The 'Pin'
The curves on the front and sides of the Pin make manoeuvring the puck a difficult task. Rather than going directly for the puck, it's often much more effective to control the puck from the side in a circular motion. This makes the game a little difficult to begin with, but allows for a much greater level of precision and skill once the basics have been understood.
Features:
Battle it out in local multiplayer across11 different arenasTest yourself against the clock in8 different single-player Target Smash levelsPlay 1v1, 2v1 or 2v2 matches against your friends

Supported Controllers:At least one controller isrequired to play Pin Puck, however avariety of popular game controllers are supported, including:

<p>I love precision platformers, but they've always been really difficult. 
Mobility is my attempt to make the genre more accessible, with different
 difficulty settings, accessibility options, and a browser version. (Die-hard fans, though, can also ignore all that and just 
play everything on the highest difficulty. Your choice!)

In Mobility, every platform 
is a switch you activate upon contact. The goal in each 
level is to activate all platforms, making each level a little puzzle, 
especially when you're attempting to score a new record. In the story, 
these rooms are engine rooms on spaceships that you (a repairman in 
training) has to fix.
I made this game over two years, in my free time during my game design study. While I am not charging for this game, if you enjoy it consider voting with your wallet to support me with making more games in the future.

<p>Three Red Hearts is a love letter from me to the Chiptune genre. Growing up surrounded by what is now considered "retro" video game music, Chiptune was incredibly formative to my development as a composer.
The original album can be previewed and downloaded here: http://abstractionmusic.bandcamp.com/album/three-red-hearts
The Prepare to Dev edition strips each song down to a raw WAV file, designed to loop perfectly within any media you import it into.
This pack contains 24 original Chiptune (or Chiptune-inspired) songs. Many of them were created in a program named Famitracker, which is a NES soundchip emulator. 
While these songs are listed as pay-what-you-want, if you do plan on making money off your game (either through ads, microtransactions, or direct sales), please donate what you think is fair for this content. <3

<p>
Feudis a turn-based strategy game made by some guys you haven't heard of yet. Originally a board game designed by Dave Cordell, it's been polished and tweaked and generally mucked about with to bring it to the glowing screen you're reading this description on. Unless you printed it out? Think of the trees. Please.
Condensed abstract strategy!
Imagine chess, but on a four-by-four grid, where pieces are swapped rather than moved, each piece has its own special ability and--OK, not so much like chess. What youcanexpect is a highly condensed little abstract strategy game which is easy enough to learn but quite tricky to get good at. The AI still beats us sometimes. The computers are winning. Please get good at Feud so we can beat them.
Cross-platform!
Feud has full cross-platform play between PC, Mac, Linux, iOS and Android. This means you can play Feud at your boring job, then on the bus on the way home from your boring job, then on your computer at home while you recover from your boring job.Please note that wedo not recommendplaying Feud during your commute if you walk to work, especially if you live in a city with lots of open manhole covers which is pretty much what I imagine New York to be like. I dunno, I've never been.
You haven't told me much about this game yet, to be honest!
I'm not very good at this. Sorry. Anyway, look, the game's pay-whatever and only a couple of hundred megabytes. You might as well, really.</p></li>

IT'S STORYTIME
There was a time when The Agent was one of the most ass-kickingest special operatives on the block.

pitch:
it's 30,000 years into the future and as far as art school is concerned, the more things change, the more things stay the same. you take on the role of evalynn cott, a creative twenty-something with severe motivational problems; the end of the semester has rolledaround and wouldn't you know it, you're late on turning in a few things! how long will it take you to muster up the courage to send off those dreaded "so sorry, but a few things came up - here you go!" type of emails?


this is a story about trying to maintain your mental health and as such - has the potential to get dark in spots. be advised before playing.

<p>J.U.L.I.A.: Among the Stars is a very well written and beautiful game, especially when you take into account that most of it was done by two people.9/10 Kickstart VenturesOverall I highly recommend this game, I think it might be somewhat of an unexpected treasure for those who love old style point and click adventures. Its definitely a refreshing, thorough and intricate take on the genre. Its very well written and I found it a bit of a page turner the ending is satisfying and makes sense.4.5/5 Gamers FTWJ.U.L.I.A. Among the Stars largely took what it got right in the already enjoyable original version and improved upon it, then added some welcome new content on top.4/5 Adventure Gamers
STORY
After countless years of careful space observation, the enormous telescope Chandra 17 suddenly locates a solar system quite similar to our own. As all earthly observatories turned their attention towards this new discovery, a signal of artificial origin is detected from deep within the system.
Reaction was immediate and a mission plan was conceived. No expense was spared in the construction of a massive space probe. It was designed and equipped to be ideally suited for the ultimate challenge: to meet and study extraterrestrial sentient life-forms. Equal care was taken with the crew. Only the most prominent scientists were selected and trained to ideally represent planet Earth. Everything was perfectly planned and success was certain. Yet somehow, everything has gone terribly wrong
Now, imagine being jolted awake by an emergency alarm. As your surroundings come into focus, you realize you were deep in cryogenic sleep on a vast space probe. But why you are there is an elusive memory. Disoriented, you rush to the control room searching for answers. Once there you learn from the ships AI that not only have you been asleep for decades, but you are also the last surviving member of the probes crew.To make matters worse, the probe is severely damaged by a disastrous impact with a passing meteoroid swarm. First, you must make repairs. Not only is your own survival at stake, but you need to find out what happened to the crew and why you alone survived.
Are You Prepared to
step into the spacesuit of Rachel Manners and find out why she was the sole survivor of this ill-fated expedition?utilize an ingenious MOBOT  a mobile robot designed for planetary exploration to investigate this solar system and all its wonders?solve the mystery of the missions failure and locate the missing crew?travel to six unique planets and uncover their secrets?solve puzzles, gather clues and communicate with the most temperamental artificial intelligence ever designed?Are you prepared for J.U.L.I.A.
And there is more!
You'll get a beautiful hintbook, soundtrack and one more game called J.U.L.I.A: Untold.

A Victorian Steampunk RPG where saving the Kingdom requires more than just brains and brawn: you also need to talk to people! Featuring a debate battle system, talk, debate, convince and negotiate with NPCs in order to save the country!

A decade ago, a devastating civil war rocked the country of Gataela. Though the country has recovered, the victims have not, and Zack - one of these - heads to the local Lord to request aid. However, along his way, his journey leads him as far as the capital, stirring up the old flames of war.

Travel the country, talk to the locals, and convince them to help you! 
The game focuses on exploring and talking to NPCs. There is your common JRPG gameplay elements, such as turn-based battles, skits, and so on, but the game largely focuses on stopping to smell the flowers. Who knows if that child complaining about a bully will lead you to discovering something that could change the course of the country!

Two Battle Systems: Timed turn-based, and Debate battles where you can negotiate, convince, and debate with NPCs
Speaking to NPCs is important: NPCs can give you the facts you need to back up your arguments in debates
Skits: Get to know more about the characters and the world
Skills level up with you: The more you use a skill, the better you'll get at it
Point allocation: Distribute points each time you level up and build your party however you want
Science is on your side: Use gunpowder and science to craft items which can help you get out of a pinch
Costumes: Changing your outfit will also change your overworld's appearance, and their appearance in skits

Q: Can I do a Let's Play/Review/Stream of the demo?
A: Yep! Go for it! We'd also love to see it~
Q: What are the minimum requirements to play the demo?
A: Windows 7, 8 or 10 with at least 8GB of RAM. 
Q: Is this an RPGMaker game?
A: Nope! Gataela is built using Gamemaker Studio 2.
Q: How long is the demo? How long will the final game be?
A: The demo is approximately 3-5 hours long depending on your familiarity with RPGs. Based off that, the final game will be around 30-50 hours long. </p></li>

<p>Uno, a newborn lifeform composed of dense steel, buzzy circuits and disjointed, static memories, wakes up, looking through a frosted cerulean ceiling. On its inside drive, weird images, and a text file with instructions. 

The Subject's test has begun. Meet me at the top of the Obelisk.

"Where am i?"  "How did i came into existence?"       "For what purpose?"         "By the hands of whom?" 

Isolated in a hidden point of our universe, the Obelisk is a true wonder land, far from the 01's chains of morality and ethics. A place of true scientific progress and rebellion against the deterministic laws of nature's causality.
There's no other way. All the answers, reasons and a way out, lies at the top. 

Unobelisk is a solo turn based, exploration game focused on resource management and puzzle solving. 
With level design inspired by classic Resident Evil games and Metroidvanias, puts the player in the logic circuits of Uno, exploring an obelisk-shaped space station for a path to the top of the structure, where a way out is promised.
The not exactly linear progression of the game is blocked by a number of riddles, passwords, keys and the mysterious threat of the primordial ghosts, along with your own Subject brothers and even the 4 scientists themselves.
On the other hand, optional puzzle solving and exploration  are rewarded with upgrade modules, that grants better ammo capacity, maximum health boost, greater evasive perfomance or stronger offensive capabilities.
Under normal conditions, the game can be finishedbetween 10 and 20 hours, though finishing in less time is possible by skipping text content or simply knowing your way through the Obelisk.
A Puzzle helper function is available on the options menu for those stuck in Unobelisk. It doesn't skip any puzzle, but hints to solve them gets more obvious in some text files or even on the map.
There's also a challenge difficulty mode if the default one feels too easy. A ranking system exists exclusively for this mode, rating the player's performance based on the final game playtime, number of times healed in restoration devices or the collection of optional modules. 

Controllers are natively supported. The ones using the DirectInput standard will have problems with button placement but there's a menu option fixing this. 
While there's only one active dev behind Unobelisk, it uses assets, music, raw graphic materials and others from a number of people that makes their great work available with free licenses. Credits can be seen in the game's options menu.Feel free to send feedback, relate bugs, or ask anything in the comments.A pgina do jogo no Itch.io est em ingls devido ao padro do site, mas Unobelisk pode ser 100% jogado em portugus do Brasil, alm da lngua inglesa.Por ser padro da loja, a verso completa do jogo vai ser vendida em dlar, e no contar com preos regionais. Todos sabemos que o valor atual do dlar  completamente absurdo, por isso estou estudando maneiras de vender o jogo a um preo justo de formas alternativas, por enquanto exclusivamente para brasileiros.No posso confirmar 100%, mas a idia  lanar uma pgina em portugus independentemente, com formas de vender o jogo em R$.Qualquer coisa, s comentar abaixo. </p></li>

<p>Ex Novo is a playable city-building generator to construct fictional villages and towns. This physical game can be played alone or with up to 3 friends. Playtime ranges from 1 to 3 hours.
Meet with your friends and collaboratively draw the map of your city as you explore the conditions that led to its founding and the events that shape its development.
Our aim was a generator that buildssettlements that are useful for further creative use. For example innarrative endeavors or as preparation forpen and paper role-playing games.
Please share your cities with us using the hashtag #exnovo.
Created byMartin NerurkarandKonstantinos Dimopoulos.

Playing Ex Novo
You (and up to three friends) take on the role of the guardian spirit of a freshly founded settlement. Its founding just brought you into existence. And with it it brought you your purpose: to witness its growth, shepherd its development and remember its stories.
As you play you will make sense of the events happening as you draw and plan on a collaborative map of the settlement and its changing shape. In the end you will have created an interesting fictional place with a sense of history.
Sequence of Play
Play begins with a brief discussion phase. Here each player shares their assumptions and expectations. You will also determine city size and age in this phase.
Then we move tothefounding phase. Taking turns, each player defines some of the basics of the settlement, such as its purpose or the surrounding terrain. Whenever a feature is determined the acting player will draw it ontothe map. By following the predefined sequence of turns you will end up with an interesting starting situation.
After this you enter into the development phase. Here each turn adds an interesting event that needs to be interpreted by the active player. During this time the settlement will grow, change or even shrink.This is where the exciting history of your city is played out, its shape evolves and the map grows.
The final phase is the topping out phase. Here a few quick turns are all that's needed to wrap up the development of the city and tie off all loose ends.
And finally you'll be left with an interesting settlement that you can enjoy or use as a jumping off point for something else, like a role-playing campaign.</p></li>

Asmall little RPGmaker game about a lonely girl with a connection to another world that she sees in her dreams.
WARNING:May contain some loud and prolongedlow/high pitchmoments and unsettling atmosphere/elements. May also contain some flashing lights moments!!
Tem here!!!It's my first time making an RPGmaker game!! Its my first time trying to put together my own project outside of an animated thing (though... I guess this is still sort of.. that..). I've always wanted to make an RPGMaker game, though I guess it isn't much of a game. Its around 15-20 minutes long (though I guess it could be longer if you try to get all the endings).There's around 4 different endings you can get.Asmall warning that one of the endings is a little creepy/unsettling.. But hopefully its not too much. Also... occasionally a movie might freeze... I'm not really sure what causes this, if it happens, try restarting the game. I'm sorry if this happens :( It seems like this has been working for some people as a fix, so you could give it a try!https://itch.io/t/432226/found-a-way-to-fix-tv-scene-crashing-bugsThank you for stopping by!! I hope you like it!! I'll try to make more one day.Hopefully I set up the downloading option right where you don't have to pay for it. But feel free to donate if you'd like to support me!!

<p>How a Wargod Found Peace! is an original soundtrackby Michael Cherdchupan
It is featured in"Oh My Gore!" is a strategy game by Bumblebee Games and Daedalic Entertainment. It's a mixture of tower defense and RTS with a pixel art-style.


	I was responsible for several aspects of the game, mainly the audio, the story & narrative design and - for the most part - level design. It's definitely a quite uncommon game with a story that mixes an odd sense of humor with some serious tones and messages about war. I think the soundtrack reflects that pretty well since it crossfades from 8-bit-tunes, humorous melodies to rock songs and war marches. 
	

	With about 2500 SFX-soundfiles, a german voice-over with 16 characters and 2,5 hours of music the audio part of the game is quite huge for an indie title. It's the result of two years of work :D 
	

	The game can be played in English and German. You can find more information on it here:

stuff ppl said about the games. omfg <3
"Indie game developer ceMelusine makes brief, simple games that offer the player poignant moments of loneliness." - Leigh Alexander (Offworld)
"As simple as the gameplay is, every time I boot it up, I find myself hypnotized by the atmosphere and the language. There's something about Oracle that feels oddly grand and ancient." - Danielle Riendeau (Polygon)
"Like the declarations of Mountain, I find the symbols and prophecies pleasing to contemplate; they're little focuses for reflection." - Alice O'Connor (Rock Paper Shotgun)
"The games juxtapose the arcane and the comfortable, asking you to find meaning and purpose." - Heather Alexandra (Kotaku)


But ceMelusine! I can't afford to pay for these games/am press!

	That's totally cool. I still want you to play the games, so feel free to email me at ceMelusine (at) gmail.com and tell me which games you are interested in playing. I'll will totally hook you up with a copy. Also maybe follow me on the tweester or something (@ceMelusine).

<p>Gods arent exactly common, but there are a lot of them, it turns out. If a person sees a god, it usually means the latter is in troublethe modern world has many mysteries the gods havent completely figured out. But some charitable person is inevitably around to help out these flustered deities, who then invariably grant these kind souls a wish.
And if a lot of wishes are being granted at once, well, it's easy to lose track of what you want.
Cat Wishes is my second light novel, this time about a small group of friends, divine intervention, and the ups and downs of their day to day life as they adjust to some pretty dramatic changes. As always, it's full of personal growth, self-discovery, and a lot of gender feels.
Please enjoy, and let's keep making wonderful things together.

I should reach the frontier within six weeks. With a little luck the network will pick me up. This is Ripley, last survivor of the Nostromo, signing off.
- Ellen Ripley

The Wretchedis a solo journaling RPG played with a deck of cards, a tumbling block tower, and a microphone.
You are the last surviving crew member of the intergalactic salvage ship The Wretched. Adrift between stars after an engine failure, your ship was attacked by a hostile alien lifeform. The crew are dead.
You thought you had won. You launched the creature out of an airlock, and that should have meant safety.
It didnt.
< - - - >
The Wretched is a game about human resilience in the face of overwhelming odds and almost certain death. It is a game about isolation, fear, and perseverance.
You play a lone survivor of an horrific attack. You have seen and done terrible things, you have seen your friends - your found family - brutally butchered by something you cant even begin to comprehend, something that you were sure didnt exist until it manifested itself aboard your ship.
You are existing on the edges of your endurance, high on adrenaline and fear and desperation. You are sure you wont survive this, but all you know to do is to keep fighting.
The Wretched is inspired by the music of John Carpenter and Nine Inch Nails, as well as Monolockby Ben Chong, and You Are Not Alone In This Lifeand you will die alone out here in the black by Auden Roswell.

Becoming a witch takes a lot of hard work, and not everyone has the resources to devote themselves to such a grueling process. But thankfully, magic isnt completely unattainable!

Substitute Familiar is the most worldbuilding-heavy light novel Ive written yet, depicting a modern world with magic, demons, and folks trying to make it work. Its about getting the chance to try something youve wanted to do for a long time, and all the unforeseen consequences that come with it. It also has a lot of self-actualization, girls kissing girls, and gender feels, because thats what I do!

That was the thought that spawned Songbirds, and it aims to carry forward the idea of combating those intangible things that we struggle with on a daily basis. I know I've wanted to punch my anxiety in the face on numerous occasions. Well, now we can. Together.

CowboyBoats"This is breathtaking work! I just read the whole thing cover to cover. This game is basically Ghibli / Dianna Wynne Jones meets Nobilis; I can definitely see people in my circle showing up to give this a try at least for a one-shot."

<p> 
      Last Knight is over-the-top non-stop jousting action in a beautiful brutal fantasy world! 
        It comes with bucketloads of content and is inspired by outstanding third-person platformers like Crash Bandicoot. 
        It uses the Unreal Engine to bring it all to live... 
Key Features:


OVER-THE-TOP JOUSTING! -
 Countless enemies had been shot, hacked and slashed in the history of 
games. Now it is time to ram a wooden lance in some gut, send your foes 
flying, and watch them bite the dust! Body parts ripping off, ragdoll 
horse physics, and destructive environments included. 
A BEAUTIFUL BRUTAL WORLD 
 Dive into a magical fantasy world full of treasures and adventures! 
Don't be fooled by the cartoony looks: here, simply bumping into a silly
 wooden fence spells a sudden end to your hero's life. If you fancy 
dying in a more heroic way, how about getting swallowed by a giant toad,
 falling into a lava pit, exploding from eating too much turkey, getting
 impaled by a Hitler Snowman, or just getting lit on fire by a dragon! 
BUCKETLOADS OF CONTENT 
 Divided into three major parts - the Story Mode, the Endless Journey 
Mode and the Rogue Rider Mode - this game has a lot to offer and there 
is always something new to accomplish, find, or unlock. Power-ups, 
characters, view modes, mutators, quests, game mode variations, randomly
 generated hats, you name it! Did you ever wish to be a skeleton king 
with a fancy wig riding over rainbows on a flower-pooping pink unicorn? 
It's all up to you in this game! 
INSPIRED BY CRASH BANDICOOT 
 Good third-person platformers were always hard to find on PC, when 
consoles sport countless shining examples: the first Crash Bandicoot 
titles, Spyro, Ratchet & Clank, and Super Mario were all a big 
inspiration for Last Knight. This game kicks it up a notch with non-stop
 jousting action, no-health instant death, procedurally-generated 
worlds, as well as custom-crafted levels with Knightmare levels 
in-between. To top it off, the new Rogue Rider Mode pushes it all into a
 rogue-like direction, and if you don't like third-person view, try 
playing in first-person mode! Follow Toco Games on Twitter: https://twitter.com/TocoGamescom</p></li>

Praise for Sun Dogs: 
Kill Screen: "... vagueness and ambiguity are their own virtues in Sun Dogs." 
Offworld: "The real meat of the game is the text, lush but brief, that appears to illuminate the vast array of worlds and cultures you explore."
Emily Short's Interactive Storytelling: "The biggest appeal for me was simply drifting from place to place and investigating all the unusual places and events." 
FailBetter Games: "... a memorable and intelligent flavour to its economically written stories." </p></li>

Subterrarium is a game about digging your way home throughunconventional means. Collect money from dirt, use it to buy soda from vending machines, and then use that soda to water the seeds scattered around the level. 
Every plant gives you an advantage, whether it's a vine that allows you to reach great heights, or a bombplant that clears out a chunk of dirt for you. But be carefulwith every move, the dirt becomes more unstable. One wrong step could lead to a fatal cave-in.

<p>NOW AVAILABLE ON: Android, iOS, Windows, and MacOS.monad is meant to be experienced in a dark, quiet room, on a large screen with a surround-sound system or headphones, and with a multi-touch screen for input.monad was initially conceived as an experiment with space, wherein at the very moment that the player engaged with the system, a white circle began to grow, unrestrained, until it occupied the entire screen, the entire space. Leaving no room for agency.The black circle came about as a means for the player to regain space. The soundscape came about in order to give more dimension to the feelings that the visuals were already evoking.
monad is made with LVE, with help and support from that community as well as Louisville Makes Games.

<p>You are Daughters of Lightning, a rider of storms, and breaker of mountains. You are warriors, lovers, and legend.


You are also teenagers.


Barely of age for the throne, you have been kicked out of your immortal homeland and stripped of your powers for another one of your stupid (brave!) antics (deeds!!!).


As outcasts, you must work together, prove yourselves, andreturn home.

HEART & LIGHTNINGis a rock-inspired, sword and sworcery tabletop roleplaying game about teenage gods, rebellion, and the troubles they get into. 
Play as the Daughters of Lightning, almighty children who embody storms, its power, rage and tenacity. Stubborn and young, you've recently been evicted from your heavenly home and must complete a quest to return. 
This game is currently still in development, but for now consists of a 70-page mostly Player's Side booklet which includes:
 Character creation rules to create your very own Daughter of Lightning. Pick from a variety of Mythic archetypes like The Redeemed, The New, The Quiet Before The Storm.
 Wield your godly powers with Domains and Talents. Change your form at will into beasts, instantly capture the hearts of those who lay their eyes on you, or call down a lightning strike.
 Heart & Lightning rules that let you play and resolve tasks with either your emotions or ALMIGHTY STRENGTH. Use Pain, Hype, & Glory to see how you approach your problems: Will you rely on connections, noise, or power?
 New and improved combatrules. Beat your foes into submission, or try to hold back so they don't immediately perish from your godly strength.
Factions for the Daughters of Lightning to interact and face against. Throw at them a host of cool and interesting NPCs; fight off Mooks and Bosses from the ambitious Humans, disgusting Wizards, to the most cunning of Demons.
 Additional rules for creating intense drama and endings in your next game session. Break hearts, destroy the things you love, and discover how much being a teen god can suck.

<p>Life is tough for the cash-strapped in Pociopolis. Ever since the secret to immortality was discovered, nobody retires anymore! With all the steady jobs taken and no sign of any new ones opening up, theres only one sure way to make some quick cash: sign up as a Subway Runner and work for the Metro Authority to hunt monsters and repair subway lines below the city.
SUBWAY RUNNERS is a Forged in the Dark game of gig economy adventures designed from the ground up to be played online by folks who are responsibly practicing social isolation. It uses online tools to quickly create random characters, gigs, and adventure details so players can get the ball rolling quickly.
What's Cool About Subway Runners?
I'm thrilled you asked!
We Got Wild with Random Generators!
You can make a character by going to perchance.org/subwayrunners, get them a gig by going to perchance.org/subwayrunnersgig, and get all the details you need for their adventure by going to perchance.org/runsubwayrunners! You're basically already playing. Also, each page has a Print File button on the bottom to save your runner's promotions as a PDF for posterity of future adventures!
Forged in the Dark with a Twist!
Like other Forged in the Dark games, you leverage your actions to take risky actions, get stressed and catch traumas, and do fun stuff to get promotions. Unlike any other Forged in the Dark game we know of, your list of actions is totally different from your fellow runners! You never know the trauma you're gonna get, from "rude" to "romantic"! Both your experience triggers and your benefits for doing them change from runner to runner and game to game! And if you don't like the runner you got, another file is just a click away.
Designed with Social Isolation In Mind!
A lot of folks are staying home right now, and making good choices for their community by limiting their in-person contact with others. Subway Runners is designed to run easy-breezy over discord, zoom, roll20, or wherever you hang out with your chums online! Toss a shared whiteboard in there if you're feeling fancy, or take notes in a shared google doc. On top of all that, the rules reference PDF is great to help players new to the FitD system get started quick.
The PDF has bookmarks!
That's not very cool, but Dan was real excited about it so we thought we'd mention it here.Praise for Subway Runners"This game is totally zonkers. Love it."-Enny nominated tabletop RPG master Rob Hebert</p></li>

<p>Something's not right with the world. There's a rot around you and it's getting closer.
Catch The Devil is a game about normal people caught up in forces beyond the real. As a player you'll create a normal person and explore how they react to being caught up in events that can't be real. As a GM you'll take your fears and make them manifest in the world of the characters as a rot that has designs on the player characters.
When the player characters come under stress they will change in unexpected ways. The core rules of the game are different for each character reflecting the different ways people handle duress.
Catch The Devil is by Sage LaTorra, co-designer of DungeonWorld. It reflects years of experience with Powered By The Apocalypse games and a growing anxiety about the world we live in.
The current version of Catch The Devil is a complete game playable for 1-3 sessions. Over time I'd like to expand it to a larger game based on some interesting ideas about how to handle GM planning, character change, and the passage of time.By buying the current version you'll get any future updates for free and help support ongoing development.
Investigate, fight, or flee: there's a rot around you and it's getting closer.

Trust System Sliding Scale Pricing

	This game took me quite a long time to write! I also make a living from my art: I don't have another job. And I'm really proud of it and want it to be valued. But I also know that the market value of any given piece of digital art is effectively zero, and that many of the folk who might want to play this aren't earning much money either, and that most of the economic options available to us aren't particularly palatable, and that I want you to play this more than I want to get paid. So here's my suggestion.
I've set 4 as a rough price for this game based on a triangulation of how long it took me, how much I hope to sell, how experienced I am, how the art market functions, how much I think folk are willing to pay, and sheer guesswork. (Mostly guesswork.) If you're earning an average wage (UK: c26k) then pay me that. If you're earning more, pay me more. If you're earning less, pay me less. If you're earning less than the Living Wage (UK: c16k) then don't pay me anything, and I hope you enjoy the game. This system isn't policed, and if you've got a better idea of how artists should make a living (I hope you do!) then pay whatever you think is right.
Alternatively, support me on Patreon from a buck a month and get access to all the work I make for no extra charge.

<p>A strange deck of playing cards.A stranger appearing from a sudden storm.The sheltering doorway of a lonely manor.Unliving dolls smiling emptily as they chase you down.
They just want you to join them. Forever.
String Tyrant is a survival horror game where you must look, think, hide, and if necessary, fight your way out of a mysterious mansion filled with monsters and traps.
If you're defeated by a monster or fall for a trap, you'll be ensnared by the manor's residents - and join them to hunt your former friends. At least you'll be a pretty doll.
The game has an active card-based combat system where you build combos using your magical cards. You can hear nearby enemies through doors and walls, can open and close doors to try to break line-of-sight, and must contend with traps that will tax your wits. You'll need to unlock the secrets of the manor to stand a real chance of escape.
A free demo is provided. Please ensure system compatibility with the demo before purchasing the full game.The demo covers the first "phase" of the game, featuring one enemy types, three doll types, and two endings. The full game contains more enemy types, traps, environmental hazards, new equipment, and the rest of the game's story.
Version 1.03 (April 22nd, 2020)The OSX build has been split into its own version for both the demo and full game.The Linux build has been discontinued as it is not cross-compatible with any other Linux versions. Version 1.02a will remain available for download for any Linux users who happen to be running Mint.
If you are a Linux user and would like to play the game, a guide has been written here by friendly user Bicobus. The guide is slightly outdated - the engine repository is here. You will need to compile the game for your distro, but the process is relatively painless.
The OSX version was compiled on OSX 10.14.6 Mojave. As above, please contact the team if you wish to compile the engine on another version.

<p>
For the Dungeon!is a comedy role-playing game where you get to play as the hapless minions instead of the heroes. Experience the rush of unquestioning loyalty to a darker power and charging into danger with reckless abandon! Raid villages, scout ancient ruins for artifacts, and protect the dungeon from homicidal adventurers.
Instead of a well established world, the game uses principles taken from Powered by the Apocalypse style games and improv comedy to create the setting.For the Dungeon!relies heavily on player created prompts that are interpreted by the Game Master to reveal the details of the world.
The game is designed to be fast-paced, with a focus on creating memorable moments. Because the game is light and has a greater focus on the story, anybody can pick up and play with minimal effort. The fun is created more through the unexpected scenarios the players get themselves into than by studying rules.

So how do you play? Characters are represented by a set of short descriptions called traits. They cover a character's skills, equipment, and motivations. Traits provide an easy way to know both who your character is and what they're good at.
Something inherent to being a minion is their penchant for chaos. Critical failures are a core part of what makes the game unique and fun. Whenever the characters critically fail the player provides a prompt that the Game Master uses as inspiration for whatever hilariously unexpected misfortune befalls them.
With failure comes experience. When a minion rolls a critical failure they write down what they learned from the experience instead of tracking experience points. These experiences can be used just like traits, but only as long as you continue to succeed.
In addition to playing as a minion, all players get to influence what is going on in the dungeon. During downtime, players choose from a handful of dungeon actions that alter the world to naturally create interesting story hooks to pursue.

The mood may be spooky or intimate, heartwrenching or hilarious  it is up to you as storytellers. Dead Friend requires 1 Tarot deck or 1 deck of mundane playing cards.</p></li>

<p>Chalice is a collaborative storytelling game about a party of Arthurian knights searching for the Holy Grail. It requires one Chronicler to moderate the game and portray the perils of the world, and one or more players to portray the knights. A game of Chalice takes around 3-4 hours.
The game tells the story of the physical and spiritual descent of the knights as they quest for, and ultimately fail to find, the Grail. The knights quest is a doomed one of chivalric virtue, undone by their own fatal flaws and moral shortcomings.

<p>A simple yet challenging logic puzzle game currently in beta but nearing release! There are 92 hand made puzzles spread out across 4 difficulties along with anoption toprocedurally generate puzzles. All puzzles areguaranteed to require no guessing to solve. The puzzles can be generated with between 2-5 colors, 5 different difficulty levels, and 7 different sizes. The puzzles are intended to be relaxing, so there is no time limit and no penalties for mistakes.
Played on a hex grid, you must complete two goals to solve the puzzles. The first goal is to find a path along the grid that connects two endpoints. However, as you make the path, the hex colors will cycle. The second goal is to get all hexes to the goal color. So you must find the path that results in all hexes reaching the goal color.
Color is a important part of the puzzle, but don't worry! There is a color blind mode you can enable in the settings which will add a unique pattern on hexes for each color if you need it.
About the beta
The core of the game, the puzzle generation and mechanics, are finished aside from any tweaking that may happen before full release. Most of what's left is finalizing the art style, working on the sound design, adding music, and general polish.
Buying the beta will get you access to all beta versions, and the full game once it releases, including a steam key once the game is on Steam. The beta is also at a discounted price! The full version will be more than $6.99.</p></li>

<p>In the second half of the twentieth century, the great powers compete for military supremacy on the world stage. A team of misfitsdreamers, fighters, and government lab rats who have fallen out of the bottom of societyare reborn as soldiers of fortune navigating a web of intrigue and conspiracy. Perhaps your prime minister has been psychically attacked in his sleep. Perhaps your top scientists have disastrously opened a gate to another dimension. Perhaps your enemies are on the cusp of perfecting robotic superweapons, astral projection, or biological warfare. For the right price, those misfits can help.When youre all out of options, its time to call FIST.

<li><a href="https://levikornelsen.itch.io/schema">https://levikornelsen.itch.io/schema</a>
<p>Note:Schema is in the beta stage of anew iteration - think of this as an edition change, complete with draft, alpha, beta, and releasestages. The changes are compiled from fully tested material - it's only the document that needs polishing up to spec. Comments are active for this document, and if you've got any to give, I'm very interested!...Schema is a light engine for tabletop roleplaying with complex stakes.
Breaking that down - It is anengine, rather than agame, because assembly is required - you'll need to provide a setting and do a bit of configuring before it's ready to go. It's an engine with complex stakes - the kind of thing you might see in a Powered by the Apocalypse game, but built on the fly with a "stakes sheet" in the center of the table:
When you want this engine powering your game:
If you expect your game to have moments where there's plenty going on, where there are three different things going on to worry about and two different awesome things the character could be doing, and you don't feel like sitting there for ten minutes making a roll for each single thing... That's the ideal moment to be using Schema, because it is better at handling that than any other system.
If you'd like to see characters needing to pick in the heat of the moment between bringing down the house or feeling sure they're going to come out in one piece... and if "Are you more okay with collateral damage on this one, or more okay with getting knocked off the roof and the bad guy getting away?" strikes you as a fun thing to happen in a roll, then you should use Schema.

If you want to characters to feel like they're patiently slogging it out when they're keeping their heads down, and throwing it all to the wind when they really care about what there is to gain, you want Schema.</p></li>

Dialogue: A Writer's Story is a PC/Mac game about conversations, writing and science. In Dialogue, you play out a year in the life of Lucille, a writer working on her science fantasy novel, whose content is highly inspired by her neighbour Adrian's research subject, biochemistry.


	The game consists of various types of conversations with different mechanics. Active conversations occur in real-time, and the effect of Lucille's statements can be modified through her equipped Focus. Exploratory conversations map different subjects spatially, allowing for backtracking and finding new paths, while emails can be arranged and edited.


Dialogue combines ease and depth of play to provide a well-rounded narrative experience grounded in everyday life. The game is fully voice acted, with a relaxing soundtrack and European cartoon-inspired characters. A playthrough of Dialogue takes around 3-6 hours.






	The story in Dialogue is grounded in real life challenges and tensions, telling the story of relatable but interesting characters. We have drawn from our personal experiences to talk about the difficulties involved in two major areas.


	 The first is the creative process, both in Lucille's writing of her novel, and other people's reactions to it. The player will have insight into Lucille's struggles and triumphs as she changes characters, creates twists in the story and struggles to find a satisfying conclusion.


	The second is how real scientific research is carried out, how it is seen by people outside of the research community. Adrian's year is focused on working with his unruly cells, and the player will get to experience the worries and joys of being a researcher.
	





Hey Poor Player - "True to its name, it boasts the most comprehensive dialogue system I've ever seen in a game... In Dialogue, understanding and empathizing with people is very much an end in itself. ...I found myself wanting to be more like Lucille  someone genuinely interested in people and their complex personalities."

VideoGamer - "There's a nice mingling of science and creativity, and it realises the process of sieving information to get to the nuggets of interesting and imaginative things remarkably well."


Fuwa Novel - "Dialogue: A Writer's Story is probably the best depiction of what it's like to be a writer you'll ever find in games."

<li><a href="https://fractal-dragon.itch.io/dragonhearts">https://fractal-dragon.itch.io/dragonhearts</a>
<p>You get to be a dragon
You get to kiss dragons
Need I say more? This game is aboutabout the clash of over-sized personalities betweenshapeshifters who can assume human or dragon form, or anything in between. It's a GMless tabletop RPG, and plays best over one or two 3-4 hour sessions, for 3-4 players.What about the Dragons, though?What is the fantasy of being a dragon?To me, dragons are interesting because they embody so many seemingly contradictory elements:they are powerful but vulnerable, unyielding but capricious, even tireless-but-sleepy. The one thing they aren't, in this game, is reserved:Dragons' emotions are all turned up to 11, and they aren't afraid to let everyone know exactly how they feel.What about the Hearts, though?Notably though, while romance between characters is facilitated by the game and made as safe as possible by included support mechanics, it's also entirely opt-in: you declare on character creation whether your dragon is Open To Romance, and can change your mind at any time.And how does this game actually play?Dragonhearts is made of several small scene types you play for different situations,like if you want to havebig cool dragon duels At Each Other's Throatswhich may at any moment become liaisons In Each Other's Armsor change the entire world during Endgame:The Eclipse. Or, more importantly, you can have A Dance!Players also collaborate on world-building elements to flesh out some Truths about the world, and can change them later during the endgame!How similar is it to Firebrands?This game follows theFirebrandsFormula developed byMeguey and D. VincentBaker, and whileI was tempted to just "Find Mobile Frame Replace Dragon" I ended up doing... more than that. Most importantly, Dances are 50% longer! Also there are no coin flips or other mechanical randomizers. I've added several new games, and reworked the existing ones a bit to fit the setting.Also, wording and mechanics have been reworked to better facilitate relationshipsand battles! And snuggles!with more than two participants.

<p>"Games connect us. Sometimes this connection is to fellow players, and sometimes to new stories we get to experience for a few precious moments. But Jeeyon's games do more. Introspective, therapeutic, and physical, they focus on connecting us to the natural world, our bodies, and our inner thoughts. They're deeply personal and the connections they form have a permanence no other games do. In doing so, they're helping to define a brand new wave of game design that we're just beginning to experience." Hakan Seyalioglu, co-founder of Thorny Games and designer of Sign and Dialect

Solitaire is a collection of six games for you, the solitary player. Each game reflects the world within and without, whether you are contemplating two stages of your own transformation, a choice you must make by the water, delicately placing seeds within rich soil, or staring into the heart of a candle flame as you let memories from your previous life slide away.

A note on safety:All the games in Solitaire are meditative, introspective, and emotionally resonant. Read the text before you commit to play and check in with yourself before you dive in.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://punkpadour.itch.io/yokai-hunter">https://punkpadour.itch.io/yokai-hunter</a>
<p>A rules-lightpen & paper RPG about monster hunters in Meiji Japan.
Words, illustrations, and layout design by Chema Gonzlez.Edited by Tyler Crumrine.Layout design advice by Salva Gonzlez.Based on Tunnel Goons by Nate Treme.
HARD COPIES AVAILABLE!!Physicalcopies of the zine (+PDF) are available at Big Cartel.
FREE FOR THOSE WHO PAID FOR THE PAMPHLETIf you are one of those superkind people who paid (no matter the amount) for the pamphlet version when it was PWYW, you should be able to download the zine for free using the same link. Let me know if you have problems and we will short it out.
---
The year is 1889. After months of deliberation, a Constitution is about to be approved, giving absolute power to Emperor Meiji. In the last two decades, there have been profound political and social reforms that have cleared the way for modernization: the abolition of feudal privileges, the establishment of European-style political, police, and judicial systems, restructuring of the army, etc. But not everyone is happy with these changes.
In these convulsive years, yokai sightings and encounters have increased tremendously. Some blame the barbarians, others accuse nostalgics of the bakufu times, and a few even dare to hold His Majesty responsible. The truth is nobody knows the reason behind the uptick in sightings for sure.
The Yokai Gari Kai, or Yokai Hunters Society, has been around for centuries, gathering brave people from any social stratum willing to fight these abominations that lurk in the shadows.
---
The adventures you can play range from facing the monster of the week, to complex investigations or political plots, to routine cleansing jobs. A horror-genre approach to the games stories is recommended, with bonus points if it gestures towards the psychological horror characteristics of many Japanese films and comics.
This game was created as an entry for theGoon Jam, and it's based onTunnel Goonsby Nate Treme.
UPDATE: Pamphlet version 1.0 with margins-Added a pamphlet version with margins for easy-printing with home printers. ;)
UPDATE: Pamphlet version 1.0- Text edited by Tyler Crumrine.- Changes to match the upcoming zine version:  -New path added (Sharpness).  -All rolls are made using just six-sided dice and eight-sided dice.  -Few changes on the items table.[Updated Spanish version coming soon.]

<p>GOBLINS IN SHADOW is a roleplaying game about goblin resistance and revolution in an age of elven oppression. Its a world of clockwork and magic, of smoke and shadow. Players will take on the roles of a cell of goblin revolutionaries, working to undermine the elves and humans who have conquered their homeland and built an empire on its corpse. Theyll advance their goals by taking on scores, missions that gather sympathy for their cause or take direct action against their oppressors, ending in a final attempt to assassinate one of the elven ministers ruling the city. To do that, theyll need to avoid being caught by the Watch or the Hounds, the elite special police of the city; theyll also need to balance their obligations to the various factions of the city, as well as their own personal obligations.
The rule of elves will be broken by goblins in shadow.CONTENT WARNINGS:
Expected: death or dying; systemic oppression; body horror (each goblin starts play with a body part that is either modified or replaced with a prosthetic or elven body part, voluntarily or not at the players discretion); classism; weaponsPossible: Physical or verbal abuse; excessive violence; hostages and kidnapping; blood; animal cruelty or death; drug use; guns; smoking
GOBLINS IN SHADOW is currently in Early Access, meaning it's a fully-playable game right now but needs work to achieve itsfinal form. When you buy GOBLINS IN SHADOW you're helping me continue development on this concept in the future, and you'll be able to help by providing feedback on your experiences with the game. When the full game is released you'll probably get some kind of reward or reduced price on the final product as well.
GOBLINS IN SHADOW was originally written for #goblinweek2020.

<p>ATMOSPHERIC SPACE SIMULATION

Played entirely within fictional operating system sMaat 9Simulation of 250+ solar bodies (with light fictionalizations; see accompanying info.txt for data sources)Exploratory narrative told through email, news headlines, and REGISTRY database entries
Immersion note: For the most immersive experience, full-screen display is recommended.
CONTEXT
The year is 2221 and you are the lone technician aboard the Eye of Ra, an anti-asteroid space station orbiting Earth.
It has been two decades since the Apep event caused widespread disturbances throughout the Solar System. Ancient orbital paths and gravitational partnerships were forever altered, and our centuries-old knowledge of them was rendered unreliable. The calculated, near-zero risk of an asteroid impact on an inhabited world suddenly became unknown.
The Solar Union scrambled to recalculate the odds, to find lost objects before they could strike one of its five member worlds. Nuclear warheads were stockpiled and aimed at the skies of the Incorporated Planet of Mercury, the Republic of Mars, the Federation of Jupiter, and the Colonial Republic of Titan. Meanwhile, on Earth, they built something entirely new: the Ra laser. An orbital, Solar-powered cannon capable of reaching across the Solar System and removing kilometres-wide objects from existence.
The power within the Eye of Ra defends us all from the modern asteroid threat. The  Solar Union entrusts Earth with the protection of its member worlds, who in turn entrusts the Eye of Ra to one technician: you.

<p>52 Fatesis a unique, easy to play tabletop RPG system that uses asingle, standard 52-card deckfor all game mechanics. Two character classes (fighter and mage), diverse backgrounds for unique characters,four magic types, low hit points, and interesting strategic play options make this an unique proposition among tabletop role-playing games.Just get a deck of cards, papers and pencils to keep track of game events, and youre ready to go!
52 Fates frees players from the uncontrolled, random results of throwing dice, as they need to make conscious choices on which cards to use, when to use them, which cards to save for later, and how many cards to use in a certain play. This adds a deep layer of player agency and strategic thinking. It brings a completely new type of play where the player has some level of control over a characters fate that goes beyond role-playing decisions.
You can adapt existing OSR adventures relatively easy with the included guidelines and creature codex, plus it also contains guidelines on how to create new adventures.

	Pass work off to your opponents and fib your way up the corporate ladder in this satirical bluffing card game! Get rid of the tasks in your hand to get promotions and level up, all the way until you reach the top and become the C.E.O.!
	


In "Pass the Buck: A Game of Corporate Responsibility Management," players act as corporate employees who each have Tasks to do, Departments that determine their ability to complete Tasks, and a Level which indicates their job title. Players take turns as the Delegator, trying to get rid of all the Tasks in their hand by completing them one-at-a-time themselves, or by passing them off to their opponents for optimal efficiency. Players can bluff about whether they are in the proper Department to take a Delegator's Task, but be careful! If the Delegator believes a player is bluffing, they can call HR, which could have dire consequences.


	This lightweight card game is both comedic and strategic. If you're great at forcing other people to do your work for you, you'll be C.E.O. before you know it!

<p>Live fast. Die young. Get paid.
Those are probably words you live by, taking dangerous jobs in the hopes of getting something sweet in the end. Maybe it's clearing your name of the war crime you were scapegoated for. Maybe it's to show up your oddly attractive counterpart from halfway around the globe. Maybe you just want the money. Whatever it is, you've pulled together a crew to get this job done.

H EI S  T is a Forged in the Dark game made for single session, one-shot play that simulates the heist film genre. Major touchstones are The Losers, Gone in 60 Seconds, the Ocean's series, and the Fast and the Furious series.

The following are needed for play:
Game Rules, which include character sheetsCast Catalog (coming soon)Character Cards (coming soon)a pair of d6 dice for each player (more may be helpful)3-6 people totala space to play, either physical or virtualapproximately 2-3 hours

<p>The truth is near. Look inside.
Founded in 1806, the Hawthorne Asylum was active during a time when patients were treated less like people and more like lab rats.
Although closed down in the 50's due to changing ethical standards it is said that experiments were still being conducted for decades to come. 
This is the concluding episode to the Forever Lost story, if you haven't played the previous two episodes then please go do that now, we can objectively say they're awesome.

<p>Dream Aflame is a GMless three-player tabletop RPG in which you play as desperate survivors in a desolate land of magic and danger - and also as the land and its denizens. In it, you
are responsible for your own survival, and that of your Wicked triad.
It's up to you to learn how well you handle that responsibility, and
what relationships grow as a result. Will you learn strange secrets?
Will you build something that can last? Will you simply survive,
bickering and bitter all the while, or will something sweeter bloom
from the toxic ground?
The game uses the Belonging Outside Belonging system, famously originated in Avery Alder's game Dream Askew, and draws inspiration from a multitude of sources, including the video game Pyre and the music of The Dead South.

<p>Into the Flames is a roleplaying game about a haunted journey, specifically designed to be played in front of a campfire.
As a group you tell the story of a pilgrimage along an accursed road. Each player takes on the role of one of the pilgrims and over time uncovers their reasons for travelling - whether hoping to find treasure, escape persecution or experiencereligious epiphany.
Only one of the pilgrims will make it to the end of the road. The others will be picked off, one by one, by the spirits that follow your every step. They lurk at the edges of the flames, greedy for tribute.
Each night we will cast our offerings into the flames - a locket given bya former love, the sword that protects us, our meticulously kept diaries. We hope that what we offer is worthy. If not we will be culled, claimed into the ranks of the ghosts to haunt our former companions.
***
Into the Flamesis designed to be played over 1-3 hourswithout a GM. The 38 page rulebook contains all of the instructions for play. It can be played as a LARP around a campfire or as a traditional roleplaying game, in-front of a fire or around a table of candles.The rules are designed to be read as a group, with a simple character generation to get you playing quickly.
Any payments over $12 also get you the trinket cards - an additional resource for the game.They are not necessary for play, butallow you to skip finding or bringing your own trinkets to offer to the flames.</p></li>

<p>BeastDream is a game about befriending monsters and going on adventures with them. Battle other monsters, explore the world, make friends, and discover dark secrets. Beast Dream is inspired by video games like Pokmon, but its focus is on the adventure so you won't get bogged down by the numbers-heavy crunch that those video games run behind the scenes.
Included is The Commonwealth, an original setting built for Beast Dream.It is inspired by Kentucky, and contains original monsters, moves, and items.
Beast Dream is a Forged in the Dark game, and also my SWORDDREAM. It's made for lighthearted games where death and trauma aren't constant dangers. You don't take harm, but situations go from bad to worse and friendships can become strained by failure.
Art by Cole Riz.
Beast Dream is not complete and is still in early development! Buying the game now supports me and gets you the game when it is finished as well as all of its playtest versions! There is currently no timeline for when the game will be finished, but I am working to update it regularly.
If you want to play this game for a podcast, message me on Twitter and I'll send you a free copy! I'm also open to trading games if you're a game designer. Otherwise, if there are community copies available, feel free to claim one if you can't afford the game!</p></li>

<p>You have no idea how long it's been since you last set foot outside your cramped little apartment. You don't really talk to anyone. You can't focus on work. You barely have any appetite to speak of, literally and figuratively. Even casually reading Twitter makes you anxious.
Somehow, you thought moving to a new city would help you meet people you actually like. That you'd find fun activities to do and better opportunities all around. You used to be pretty good at faking your way around being a social butterfly. People actually seemed to like you, and the stuff you made and performed. But now? You can't even remember being that person.
Maybe you should go outside. Maybe it will help.

<p>Meet Gilbert! A very curious cat who loves to go on adventures. Play with Gilbert is a sandbox game aimed at young children (Ages 3+) in order to help them get familiarized with 3D platform games and gameplay. The game uses a simplified control scheme which allows young gamers to easily navigate their kitty around the world. The goal is to find all of Gilbert's friends and collect all the fishies.Play with Gilbert is meant to be a fun little kitty game designed to encourage playfulness within children. A game you can let your child play without having to worry about micro transactions, unlockables or trading cards. There currently is almost no skill level required to play as this game is not meant to be overly challenging.The game was designed with the help and input from my own 4 year old daughter. It started out as a small personal project to get her familiarized with a controller and to take her away from mobile app based games. Don't expect any deep gameplay mechanics, it's not meant for children who already know how to play more advanced games.Play with Gilbert does take some light inspirations from classic platformers and while adding a touch of sandbox to the mix. Gilbert, or any customized kitty can go around the levels and find his or her friends, collect all the pink fishies, or, manage to grab the golden fish from ninja lady.There are four levels in the game and two new free levels added after release. Gilbert's neighbourhood, Timmy and Tommy's house, the park and Gilbert's Play Gym. Each level has it's own kitty's to be found and has tons of places to explore, fishies to discover and collect as well as meeting other inhabitants.You can create your own kitty to play with. Complete with accessories to wear and be able to choose from a varieties of fur. You can name him or her and it'll be proudly displayed everywhere in the game. Play with... Whiskers ?Play with Gilbert also has a completely dynamic day / night cycle system implemented. You can choose at which time of the day to start the game. The cycle can be adjusted to how long a day takes, from ten minutes to one hour.You can play the game with your child or have siblings/friends play together! Local Multiplayer is still in a beta stage with new updates coming in on a regular basis. All the existing levels can now be completed with two players and more, new levels are going to be added for additional new gameplay challenges.If you're not sure PWG would be a game you or your child might enjoy then I would suggest to try out the demo first! It comes with two levels and all the customization options included in the full game! I also just wanted those who are tight on budgets to be able to have a fun game for their child to play so I made sure the Demo is quite substantial. On top of all that you can also make sure that the game runs on your system properly before you commit on a purchase.Hi Parents! As a father myself it was important to me that the design behind this game evokes a sense of exploration. The game started as a small side project meant for my 4 year old daughter to play. She loved it so much that I decided to make it into a more full fledged experience. Everything is designed around my observations watching her play and also through her own suggestions. I hope that your own child has as much fun as mine has.Also important to note is that there are no micro transactions, unlockables (everything is unlocked from the get go) nor are there any cards or achievements. These things are thrown at children constantly and I am personally not a fan of them so I decided to leave these things out.The game is about having fun, trying to find all the kittens, collect all the fish or try to get the golden fish yet it won't force or push you to do so. If you do collect everything in a level, the end reward is a nice fireworks show, nothing more. I wanted to keep the rewards to a minimum and something that means more than some unlockable reward or a high score, something that can be experienced.
Play as Gilbert or your own custom kitty.Fully dynamic day / night cycle.Start the game at whatever (in-game) time you want.Seasonal events (Halloween and Christmas).Choose which level to start and travel between levels during gameplay.Two in-game seasons, summer and winter.

<li><a href="https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/have-you-heard-about-the-beast">https://sealedlibrary.itch.io/have-you-heard-about-the-beast</a>
<p>Have you Heard About the Beast is a game of tavern rumours and hearsay. You sit in a tavern or other location where the adventurous gather and share rumours of a foul beast that lives nearby. The locals join in, adding all sorts of colourful nonsense to the creature's description.
Thing is, every bit of it true.
Glowing eyes the size of shields and jaws that could crush your skull. Someone even told me it communes with the birds to learn out secrets.
It's true! And I heard it guards the hut of a long dead witch who knew the secret to eternal life. The one who slays it could live forever!
Its all about creating ludicrous encounters with beasts for oneshots, convention games and sidequests in your regular campaign. Play the part of the tavern patrons sharing these rumours, than take your party off to confront them.
Have You Heard About theBeast? isbroadly compatible with fantasy RPGs and highly adaptable to other settings as you provide all the stats for the creatures and content is flexible to suit your setting.
This game is played collaboratively with groups of adventurers and a GM, and will accommodate any reasonable RPG group size. The game comes with random roll tables that provide ideas but many of the best ideas will come from within your group.

<li><a href="https://ostrichmonkey.itch.io/extracausal">https://ostrichmonkey.itch.io/extracausal</a>
<p>This is Extracausal; a role-playing game about creating and uncovering a dense web of the paranatural, the occult, conspiracies, and of things far beyond it all. This is a game of encountering that which is extracausal. Imagine the Magnus Institute, the Federal Bureau of Control, Southern Reach. All groups that are involved with forces far greater than they could ever imagine, filled with individuals who piece together clues and secrets in the hopes of knowing the unknowable.
Extracausal features an easy to pick up dice engine, and simple character and world creation.Play as characters in far over their head as they race to uncover the truths about the strange, vast, dangerous, unknown forces of the extracausal. Create secrets and narrative elements that you later change, warp, shift, to form an emergent narrative web. Embrace twists and sudden reveals as you link together disparate elements into a larger, sprawling story.
Will you reach a shaking revelation? Or will reality be eclipsed by strange darkness? Play to find out.
All you need to play is a handful of six-sided dice, a few ten-sided dice, something to keep notes with, and a handful of friends.
Extracausal is in active development and feedback will help shape future versions of the game. If you play or readExtracausal please leave your feedback! Some of the first planned major additions are expanded Setting Elements to help you more easily support the themes, tone, and narrative of the game, and expanding on character creation.

What's this game about?
Well, it's a freakadelic, surreal "puzzle box" (it has one actual puzzle, which is optional - unless you want the "true ending" that is), a set of dreamy, interconnected environmentsfor the player to explore, experience, and unravelat their leisure. There is no shooting in it, and no jump scares. There are some bits that people may consider mildly spooky (or even spoopy), but I would not classify it as a horror in any conventional sense, unless you consider existential angst to be horrifying, which you should.
If you're still unclear as to what genre this game falls into, it is definitely a first person "walking simulator," optional puzzle elements notwithstanding, you will spend the majority of the game exploring and reading stuff. There is a fair bit here to explore ... and a lot to read.
What's the story, fishbone?In Pleroma, you willtake on the role of Diane Kestler, a youthful individual who has recently moved to a new part of town and isstarting a new job at a niche art gallery / studio collective / research library which is (you guessed it!) hiding a rather surprising and unusual secret. I hesitate to reveal more, as I know that many folks are spoiler averse, and personally I would like players to discover and interpret this game for themselves.Discount Coupons AvailableIf you currently cannot afford to buy or can't justify buying Pleroma at full price, but would still like to help financially support me as an artist and game maker, feel free to use this coupon code.

<p>The Wizard is just that. He wears a pointed hat. Never refer to him as anything else, through description, NPC dialogue, etc. He is the truth.
In the tranquil hamlet of Canny, there's a bounty out on a wizard. Allegedly, he wreaked some havoc before escaping to his Tower on the Hill to the north. As the characters discover the carnage he left behind and begin to explore his sinister lair, it becomes increasingly clear that whatever they're dealing with is definitely not a wizard- but he's somehow convinced everybody else that he is.
A WIZARDis an eldritchhorror tabletop game module for OSR systems. The characters ascend the Tower on the Hill, trying to survive in the face of a truly outlandish, capricious threat, and possibly stop it.

<p>You were assigned to one another. Neither of you had a choice in the matter. Perhaps you have had a hundred pilots before, perhaps you are fresh off the factory line. Maybe you are a seasoned fighter, maybe you have never seen combat outside training. Whatever the case, the powers that be who keep you in this bitter war have decided it is unnecessary for you to communicate. You will do your jobs, never quite knowing if the other is there, or how they might feel
Beyond Reach is a two person play by postgame about falling in love with someone unattainable to you. One player is a mech, the other their pilot. You will write letters that the other character may never see, but will inform your epilogues in compelling, and often heartbreaking, ways.</p></li>

	Are you a kid that wants to play with model trains?


	Are you an adult that misses playing with your model trains as a kid?


	Are you an adult that missed out on playing with model trains as a kid?


	Are you an adult with a kid that wants to play with model trains?


	Are you just an adult that wants to play with model trains?


	Are you a person of any age/race/gender that wants to play with model trains?


	If you answered yes to any of the above, do I have news for you because Locomancer lets you PLAY WITH AND RIDE MODEL TRAINS!


(Also if you answered no to all of the above, come on, we all know you're lying to yourself and everyone you love. Take a break from the wave shooters and play with some trains.)


	Locomancer is a toy box style model train simulator for touch enabled SteamVR headsets. It allows you to build layouts of varying complexity and even defy what is physically possible in fake virtual reality (reality).


Featuring:


Multiple locomotives including steam and diesel engines
A variety of rail cars including a fully functional cannon car
Straight track, curved track, inclined track, loop de loops, and more!
Various pieces of scenery to add detail your layouts


	Plus, with support for custom scenery, you can bring models created by yourself or the community into the game for even further customization. The possibilities are nearly endless*!


	Fully embracing the physicality of touch enabled virtual reality you are legally required to build layouts piece by piece, tree by tree. Then, once complete you must remotely operate your trains with a replica DC control panel or hop in the cab of any of the available locomotives and drive them with physical levers, knobs, and dials! They even burst in to flames when they crash, you can't say that about your real model trains can you?


	Oh...you can? I'd get that checked out if I were you.


	So what are you waiting for? Become The Locomancer!


	Yes, you are the Locomancer. Was that not clear? It's like a train wizard. You're like the babe with the power, but instead of voodoo it's train magic. Also, there's no magic dance, but you can still dance to twenty-six minutes of sweet big band jazz by Nathan Boler if you want to.


	*The possibilities are totally endful, but there's still a lot you can do.


At first, I was like, "Meh, kind of cool concept, just needs a bit more development time." And then he went into first person mode, and I thought "I NEED THIS GAME RIGHT THE F*** NOW!" - Bennykill709

<p>Being a taxi driver is a tough job already. Being a taxi driver with your third eye wide open and a kind heart makes it even harder. Maamser, Saan Po Kayo? translates (roughly) in English to Maam/sir, where to?. This is a 2-4 hour micro-RPG designed for 3-5 players. Its about bringing passengers where they need to be at night. Pilot a kind-hearted cabbie who does their round in Metro Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Have some of your friends play your familiars  spirits or monsters that you helped in the past, and are now trying to pay it forward. This is a city where there are just as many spirits as there are people, and they need help too. Take that wheel, hang some sampaguita on your rearview mirror, fire up Waze. Your passengers are waiting.

No previous knowledge of Filipino folklore is needed in order to play this game!In fact, I designed it with a foreign audience in mind. The game has an extensive page on landmarks in Metro Manila, some examples of the spoopy monsters that haunt our local lore, and references for people who want to know more.</p></li>

<p>A Librarians-and-Necromancy Fantasy Novel with Small Town Charm in a City of the Dead
The others believe in blood and bone. Ree believes in books.
She manages the libraries and draws maps for the denizens of her hometown, a secret society of necromancers hiding in a sprawling underground crypt. Though they look down on her for not practicing their craft, Ree has bigger ambitions than raising the dead. Shes going to resurrect therianthropy, the ancient magic of shapeshifting. Or at least -- shell do it if it really exists. And if she can find the books that prove it.
But Smythe, a chatty historian from the world above, stumbles into the crypt and takes a curse meant for Ree. Now she has to find a way to save him, keep the townsfolk off her back, and convince her necromancer parents that shapeshifting is a viable career path.
Ree is certain that if she and Smythe combine their scholarly skill sets, theyll find the right books to solve their problems. But Rees search for power might put the entire town in danger, and her father and the other townsfolk want Smythe dead lest he reveal their home to a world that hates them.SEMI-FINALIST IN THE SPFBO5 FANTASY CONTESTNOMINATED FOR BEST DEBUT IN THE BOOKNEST FANTASY AWARDS 2019

<p>Possession is a traditional turn-based roguelike where you play as a ghost trying to make your way to the surface. You are incredibly frail, but have one advantage: you can possess the bodies of the monsters you encounter, and use their strength and abilities as your own. Hop from body to body as you attempt to make it back to the surface.
Features:
Dozens of possessable monsters, from the horrifying to the hilarious, with a wide variety of powers. Special themed levels with unique hazards, creatures and layouts. Randomly generated, and each floor has multiple possible levels, so each playthrough is different!Item-less gameplay. The dead have no need for worldly possessions, they just slow you down. Quick to pick up and play. Unlike most roguelikes, Possession doesn't require you to memorize dozens of weird key commands, or puzzle over confusing skill and ability lists before you start playing. Entirely playable with just the keyboard, just the mouse, or a combination of the two. Mod support! Add your own creatures, powers and special levels, or change the ones already there. @ Choice between ASCII or Graphical mode, for the oldschool roguelike fans.</p></li>

<p>Its hollow eyes pierce your back. You can feel its fingers brush at your feet with every step you take. When you sleep, it seems to loom over you, waiting to strike.
Its always there, lurking at the corner of your eye... watching you.
 Its been days since youve had a good nights rest. The time is 4:03AM. Youre sitting up in bed, covered in sweat and shaking.
Its standing right at your feet.
 Only by unearthing the corpses of the past, long buried in your memory, can you finally exorcise this demon. Its time to face it, once and for all.
Alone With Your Ghost is a solo roleplaying game about exorcising the ghost that haunts you by delving into your memories and finding out why it haunts you. It requires a deck of regular playing cards to play.
Alone With Your Ghost is a hack of Takuma Okada's "Alone Among the Stars"

<p>"Hey, we get you, we all love the moon. Everyone here loves the moon, right?"
"Yeah."
"Oh yeah."
"Absolutely."
"Right, it's just... we think you might be going just a bit too far. We were thinkingit might be a good idea if you found love a little, like, closer to home. You know, within a few thousand kilometres. So we made you a profile on this dating site, and..."
You have to admit, they have a point. You really do love the moon way more than they do. Not in an unhealthy way, though, right? Well, it doesn't matter.Little did you and your fellow moon-cultists/coven-sisters/moon-landing conspiracy theorists know, other groups with the same celestial idol had also gently or not-so-gently encouraged their own moon-sick acolytes to seek a more earthly love as well


Over the Moon is a 2-player role-playing dating game of dark lunar obsession, awkward online dating Q&A, and tantalisingly limited informationthat's designed for play via online messaging apps!
Each of you plays a moon cultist, witch, or other dark creature who loves the moon a little too much, and whose comrades decided to fix this by online dating with normal people but youve just been matched with each other instead, and its up to you to see if you can make this work. Is the moon your one true love, a third wheel in the sky, or the ultimate wingmoon? Play to find out!
The game plays out over the course of a full moon cycle, starting just after the new moon, and changes with the moon's phase and visibility in the sky.On top of the rules, the game also includes:
32 Dating Questions - a mix of bland, serious, and strange8 special Steamy Questions, if you're feeling brave
JUST to be clear: In this game you communicate with each other using a regular messaging app like Discord. You don't have to actually match with each other on a dating site or dating app! Unless you're feeling dangerous, that is. Likewise, there's no adult content unless you both choose to include it.
(Version 1.1 will be released shortly, including corrections, tweaked questions, minor rules updates, and accessibility improvements.)

this is a game where you play asqueer witches who work in a restaurant, using brute force, magic, and the power of gay to handle whatever your GM (General Manager) throws at you.
i wanted to experiment with making a game that is explicitly designed for the GM to be antagonistic toward the player characters, in a way that mirrors real life power imbalances most of us have had to deal with.
please be sure to discuss safety tools before running the game. this may become especially important in a game explicitly designed to have a hostile GM role.see the TTRPG Safety Toolkit by Kienna Shaw & Lauren Bryant-Monk for a thorough survey of commonly used safety tools and consent mechanics.
this game works best with 3-4 players and a GM. each player will need 2d6, a blank sheet of paper, and a pencil. it is designed in such a way that sessions can be very short or very long, depending on the amount of detail the GM decides to include.

<p>Jarboes outstanding debut collection demonstrates a flair for queer surrealism and an ear for lyrical prose. In the powerful Self Care, a nihilistic youth, who identifies as a gay transsexual witch, is displaced by apocalyptic flooding and takes refuge in Our Lady of Good Voyage, a Catholic church. I Am a Beautiful Bug! turns Kafkas Metamorphosis on its head with a tale of a person undergoing surgery to look like the giant bug theyve always wanted to be (Gimme the works, doctor! Just like Gregor Samsa!). The pieces range from brief vignettes that read like prose poetry to much longer works like the title story, which tells of a young man deciding to join the masses of defunct service cyborgs, addicts, migrants, drop-outs, single parents, [and] estranged children on the holy colony of the Moon. Throughout, Jarboe melds tenderness, humor, and righteous anger into insightful tales of characters navigating the margins of society. Readers are sure to be blown away.[Publisher's Weekly starred review]

Sixteen stories of mid-apocalyptic science fabulism, body horror fairy tales,queer Catholic cyberpunk, and blue-collar resistance.

<p>You are part of the Mount Qaf Exploitation Project. Months ago, your corporate backers discovered something marvelous. Something miraculous. A method to tunnel into another realm, into the legendary Mount Qaf, the barrier between the worlds of man and djinn. An opportunity to connect with another species! To leapfrog our understanding of metaphysics! History! Ourselves! A thing with unlimited potential to advance the human condition!
Naturally, you started doing horribly unethical science experiments and bickering over funding. This will probably kill you, and itll probably suck, but that isnt important.
What is important is this: When they pick over the ruins of this horrorshow, you will have named the creatures gnawing at your bones.
This Is My Final Recording is a rules-light game that aims to create the apocalyptic logs so common in video games and found footage media. You play the employees of the Mount Qaf Exploitation Project as your capitalistic over-reach results in terrible and unknown creatures that try to murder you. It is designed to be easily playable through the restrictions of social distancing guidelines, with letters, emails, and text communications all valid modes of play.

<p>Game Overview
The Wind Began to Howl is a song fiction tabletop role-playing game that brings 2-3 players together with the iconic ballad All Along the Watchtower to create stories of intimate conspiracy and desperate adventure.
  
Each two to three-hour session offers a zero-prep one shot experience built around the popular Forged in the Dark action role playing game system, easy to fit into busy schedules or between sessions of longer-form RPGs.
  
Two players take up the roles of the Joker and the Thief from the song lyrics, while an optional third player can join in to help facilitate the game by referencing the rules and playing other characters in the world.
  
Play is guided by listening to the four verses of the song, with the first three verses setting up the conspiracy of the Joker and the Thief, and the final verse playing out their assault on the Watchtower. Each verse is accompanied by rules and establishing questions that work with the lyrics to build a vivid game world.
  
The final verse plays much like a fast-paced score from Blades in the Dark, and the results decide the apocalyptic fate of the conspirators, the Watchtower, and the world that surrounds them.
  
The Song
Ominous and conspiratorial, Bob Dylans All Along the Watchtower is one of the most iconic ballads of the 20th century, and has continued to inspire covers, adaptations, and new creations ever since its first release in 1967. Watchtower has become emblematic of the tumultuous years of the Vietnam War, and has hardly lost its relevance in the new millennium. From Battlestar Galactica, to Watchmen, to Sons of Anarchy, fiction continues to reference the music and lyrics in a way that defies the restrictions of genre and setting. Each generation and individual find their own connection with the work and give it a unique expression of their own.   
The Wind Began to Howl is a catalyst for these connections, allowing players to interpret the enigmatic and evocative lyrics on their own terms and see them come to life. Playtests have produced stories as diverse as royal court conspiracies and cyber thrillers about hacking into the systems of corrupt financiers. Each session opens the possibility of the music leading you somewhere new. 
The Characters
The Joker
There must be some way out of here

Wealthy and connected, the Joker is a creature of comfortable malaise. They are shaken out of their listless condition by the Thief and use their resources to overcome the Watchtower and its defenders.
  
The Thief
Let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late

Cunning and decisive, the Thief defines themselves through action. They rely upon their resolve in the face of adversity and challenge.
  
The Goods
The Wind Began to Howl 21 page 8.5 x 11 full color PDF, with illustrations and layout by artist Lu Quade (Including printer friendly PDF).
  A bespoke cover single of All Along the Watchtower, created by Lu Quade to accompany the game and its art. Available on Bandcamp in a variety of high-quality audio formats(name yourprice).</p></li>

Welcome to The Synth Convergence, a trilogy of missions for The Sprawl RPG built around a core theme - synthetic intelligence. Across the three mission teams will cross paths with prominent synths and be forced to confront the question of how far they will go for their Corporate paycheck in a society where inequality is rife and Corporations control every rung of the ladder.
In The Tannhauser Investment (available as afree demo) the team are brought in to negotiate the tricky process of a hostile Corporate takeover - all while evading the awareness of the synth consciousness built into the super-luxury hotel the target is holed up in.
The Infinitive Extraction takes the team to the beating heart of the entertainment districts as they seek to extract Infinitive Cascade, the hottest DJ on the circuits from an exploitative contract. But do your employers want them for their musical talents or the military codebase at the core of their personality matrix?
Finally in The Vanda-Weiss Demolition the past catches up with the team as they face off against The Evolved, an extremist fringe group dedicated to wiping out synths and returning humanity to the true path before they are toppled by their own creations.
Get in, do the job, get out. It's never that simple but if it was they wouldn't have hired professionals like you.
The Synth Convergence requires a copy of The Sprawl RPG to play. Purchase it from Ardens Ludere on driveThruRPG. Support the creators - buy the game</p></li>

Grindhouse Games Volume I collects three games from the Black Eyed Priest catalogue and presents them with new levels, enemies, and content. The three games that you receive are:
SHOTGUN - A sidescroller shooting game where you play as a mother ready to dish out bloody revenge on the low life scum who kidnapped her son. Fast paced violence and over the top characters abound throughout this game. This version of Shotgun adds new rooms and new enemies, making it even more difficult than before!

WITCHING HOUR AT HELL HOUSE - A hellish escape the room puzzle/horror game! Escape the Hell House before the "Tall Man" arrives and maybe even find the root to all this insanity within the basement. This version adds a new, never before seen puzzle and ghost to escape!

PEEPAW - Oh no! Peepaw was messing around with the Ouija board and got possessed again! Help find Meemaw and escape! That's right, your good ol' grandpa has been possessed by demonic forces and is now attempting to murder you and your family! Traverse a dark house, find your cousins for upgrades, and rescue Meemaw before you're all dragged to Hell! This version features new Peepaw behaviors.

Action, horror, thrills, and chills are at your fingertips in this sleazy collection of retro madness!
There are free versions to all of these games right here on itch.io, so this "director's cut" package is a way to help me continue making games inspired by trash cinema! They also of course come with some new bells and whistles if you're already a fan.</p></li>

<p>3D Sprites and 3D Camera Control for Construct 3





About
How about a bit of nice 3D eyecandy in your Construct 3 game?FunkyQuadZ is a pair of Construct 3 addons for 3D Sprites and 3D Camera control. It can be used with the native C3 2D game events, editor, behaviors and logicto make a game that looks likePaper Mario or Doom. Example templates show how this can be done.
Also, highly recommended is the 3DJS template fromMitsuStudios which uses FQZ for a more complete 3D rendered environment. There is a discounted bundle for both tools.
Components
There are two main components: FunkyQuadZ (3D Sprite) and FQZCamera (3D camera position and look at control.) They can be can be used separately or together in the same project. There are also some example projects included.
Beautifully Constrained 3D
Ok, this is not UE or Unity in Construct! Construct 3 behavior and logic is generally focused on 2D, but with some tricks and FQZ you can create a nice looking 3D game environment and still benefit from the great ease of use and speed of development of Construct.
Notes
It's currently simplest not to mix 2D and 3D in the same layer. It is typically better to put behavior on 2D objects in one layer and use FQZ for the 3D render of those objects in another. Using effects on FQZ is under investigation and there will be a another phase of optimizationsfor better performance. Definitely looking for feedback from users, in terms of feature requests or bugs!

<p>The Steadfast and the Rebelliousis a tabletop role-playing game and a storytelling game. It is a hack of REINCARNATION REDUX: Our Requiem by Jamila R. Nedjadi, written for Jammi Jam Jam.
You are all inhabitants of the city, and you have been living in false peace under the rule of the demon king. The last wall, which offered your city limited protection against the demon king, has fallen. Citizens are left with two choices; do everything the tyrant demands, or resist. Will we rise victorious against the demon king, or will our resistance be futile? We play to find out.
This game is intended to create a quick but rich prologue for characters who rise up against the demon king in a fantasy setting. It is possible to use this game to create a setting and characters for your preferred game about enclosed spaces and giant lizards.
To play this game, we will need 1-2 hours, 2-4 players, a deck of playing cards, a conductive space, index cards, writing materials and a copy of this game (digital or printed).

<p>Deep in the heart of an orcish homeland, torn apart by roving adventurers and power-hungry imperialists, a drow slave and a lone orc trek across hostile territory to exact revenge on an adventuring party for a a history of violences committed against them and their people...
---
Savage Blood is a story-game for 1-5 players about revenge and colonial ultraviolence - a revisionist fantasy story that flips the script and humanizes the plight and homogenization of the drow and orc civilizations by the dominant "races", especially in lieu of the real-world allusions to real-life colonization and racism present in traditional fantasy genre.
This game is best played with the intention to explore the darker side of adventuring parties in a culture that rewards treasure-hunting loners trespassing into the homelands of other civilizations and killing whoever they deem hostile.
It can also be used as a light worldbuilding exercise to add complexity to your existing fantasy world or campaign.
Savage Blood uses an intuitive technique of discovering/divining a storythrough the usage of art/tarot/oracle decks developed by@temporalhiccup inStories Of Love in Manila.This game also takes heavy design inspiration fromArchangel Dating Simulator by @mariamison. ---This game is directly inspired by recent Orcs discourse on TwitterandThe Nightingale (2018), a revenge movie directed by Jennifer Kent which deals with the exact same themes.</p></li>

12 orbits is the only game for up to 12 players at once,
no matter what you play on.


	All you need is a single keyboard, touchscreen, gamepad, dance mat, makey makey...



Features
 Local competitive multiplayer for everyone at once. Anywhere. On anything. 4 vastly different game modes to choose from Setup takes seconds, even for 12 players at once The basic mechanics are simple and can be taught to a group quickly ...yet the physical nature of the game provides you with a lot of room for mastery One Switch accessible






	You can choose from 4 vastly different game modes:
	




	 
	
 Multiball (Teams)


	Kind of like football, but with exploding goals and multiple balls at once, which change color all the time.


	
	 Arena 


	Fill the arena with spheres of your own color and avoid those of your opponents. A bullet hell that constantly grows more intense.


	
	 Trails 


	Collect spheres to grow longer than your opponents. Block their path and pay attention to your own, similar to Snake or Achtung die Kurve / Zatacka. On top of that, you also have the ability to shoot with your own spheres.


	
	 Blizzard (Teams)


	Think Pong. But you play in teams, can roam freely on your side of the court, and have to defend against a whole shower of spheres at once. 
	







	Some questions you might have:
	




 Why? 


	So you can play with everyone around you, anywhere. 12 orbits will run on almost any hardware, and any input will do. Most keyboards can only process 3 or 4 inputs at the same time, but that does not mean you can only play with 3 players. 
	
 12 orbits uses only one button per player, which you never have to keep pressed. So it is highly unlikely that many players use their button during the very same frame. While I can not guarantee that a three-button-keyboard will never ever miss a single input, there were no problems with any number of players yet.
	
 If you are on the go, or simply do not have 12 gamepads lying around, that is why. 
	







 Is this actually playable? 


	Yes! There are a few one-button-multiplayer games around that are fun or funny, but are based on a single action and don't really work for longer than 5 minutes. 12 orbits is not one of those games. It is fun of course, but this is also a game that can actually be played competitively. 
	
 It will take you only a few minutes to get the hang of the controls, but it is much harder to actually master movement and to skillfully hit spheres exactly the way you want to. In addition, 12 orbits is a lot about anticipating the movements of other players, becoming almost chess-like if you have the right opponents. 
	
 You can of course also play the game in a more relaxed fashion, especially in the team modes or with activated modifications. It's your choice.






 How many players do I need? 


	2 is enough. All game modes automatically adjust to any number of players. There are also practice modes that can be played with 1 to 12 players on one team, but that isn't the main attraction of this game. So grab someone nearby, and add players as they turn up. 
	







 Is 12 orbits One Switch accessible? 


  Yes. From the moment the game starts, it can be completely controlled with only the spacebar, including all menus. Just press it a few times when the main menu screen is shown, and on-screen prompts will further guide you through the process. More infos here.

  Is there a colorblind mode?  
 Yes. It is based on black and white symbols, so it should work for any type of color blindness.</p></li>

<p>FALL IN LOVE AND FIGHT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT AS SUPER POWERED YOUTH IN KISSING CAPES!

You will create a city despoiled by super heroic and super villainy and within it you will play young heroes, villains, and anything in between fighting with your friends and falling in love with your rivals. All you need to play is 2-5 people, a couple of hours, pencils, paper, and a coin or two to get started creating dramatic tales of super powered love, anger, jealousy, and high flying antics.

What cards am I excited to potentially get in my hand?What cards make me feel restless/uneasy right now?Based on your comfort level, select what cards will be in that session's deck.
Shuffle and Draw Cards: After shuffling the deck, players draw a card (if there are enough cards per person). If there aren't, decide who will get a card.
A Speaker Begins: Whoever is most comfortable to speak to one of their cards will go first. They are the Speaker, and will lay a card face up in the center of the table. The Speaker will answer the card and have a chance to decide if they want to voice any Needs (see rules for suggestions).
Listener(s) Response: While the Speaker is taking their turn, Listeners must pay attention to what they say, and earnestly Respond (see rules for suggestions). After Responding, the Listener can choose to share an answer to the Speaker's card in return.
Continue The Cycle: Players will continue to become Speakers in a clockwise manner. Once the group feels satisfied with the interaction, you may decide - Are you and the divine machines satisfied with the answers shared between you?</p></li>

<p>Across the twisting sea of fates, a glance catches yours and sets your heart aflame. You reach your hand out only to feel the weight of heaven disappearing beneath you, sending you hurtling down and down and down. You see their eyes, feel the threads wrapped around your hearts growing tighter as you fall. Your bodies will change. Your names, memories, and lives as well. But you will meet again. And again. And again. As many times as it takes to reach each other.
Crossing the Seven Stars is a 2-player game about useless lesbians mutually pining for each other across lifetimes, unable to muster the courage to confess first. The game is played over the course of 7 Lifetimes, with the final one containing the inevitable confession.

<p>They Wont Go When I Go is a GM-less TTRPG of ritual remembrance, funerals and grave visits for two or more players.
In it, we tell the story of a group of people and their yearly visits to a deceased friend, the Ghost. Every year, they return to perform the traditional grave rites left for them. Every year, something changes.
While playing, we will take on the roles of these Visitors. Over the course of the game, we discover their relationships with the Ghost, confront problems, make decisions and reveal stories. Each one of us will have a unique story to narrate and uncover.
Gather together, visit the deceased, piece together what you can, and complete the rites.
Made for Folklore Jam.

You want to connect in some way but dont want to just outright ask or tell them everything. This isnt the place for that. Try to let them know how they make you feel in other, more subtle ways.
The Way You Make Me Feel is inspired by Janelle Monae's "Make Me Feel" and isabout exploring a single night at a club and finding out where it all leads in the end. Will you all leave together? Apart? Just two of you? Are you friends? Enemies? Lover? Something else? None of the above?

<p>It is a fearful thing, to love what death can touch.
 excerpt from the Mourners Kaddish, as attributed to Rabbi Chaim Stern

It is morning and your dog wants to talk to you. You know of a spell that will enable them to speak to you through your words; it will take all day, and you will labor through many tasks with them in order to enact it, but let the labor be a joy and they will be able to tell you everything that is in their heart. 
This LARP is an epistolary game for two players, one of whom is a dog. Within the construct of this game dogs think of humans as ageless, near-immortal, untouched by sickness or death except in rare confluences of time. You know this is not true; but it does not matter. You will spend play time looking at the world and yourself through the eyes of your dog as you spend a day together exploring, playing, and enjoying each others company. The game will conclude with you writing a letter from their perspective, wherever they are in their life in relation to yours, to you, and then watching your dog as they dream after theyve fallen asleep at the end of the day. Play time lasts one waking day, and the morning after. </p></li>

If you grew up enjoying watching Yu-Gi-Oh (or Bakugan or any game-based friendship type of show)and thought it would be fun to be a cool anime character andhave action-filled anime card battles where the rules, numbers, and cards really don't mean anything then I think you will really enjoy this game!
While I do consider this game a finished project there are plenty of thingsI would love to add to it and/or expand on. If you play this game and have any thoughts about it, please let me know how your time with it went. It will help me know better which things may need improvement and also hearing that people played my game would make me very happy!

<p>My Welcomed Guest is a solo game about being trapped in Faerie and trying to bargain your way home. Throughout the game you will be answering questions and potentially accruing Taboo, which is an indicator of faerie taboos you may have breached. Sometimes without you knowing what action it was that directly broke the taboo. The game will be played over five acts.
This game was created as part of the Short and Easy game Jam.
You will need some additional materials:
Something to write on. You can print out the game and write directly on the paper, use a journal, an electronic source, or something else that suits your fancy.Something to write with.If you have a favorite pen or pencil, get that. If not, anything will do, a pen, pencil or crayon.A six sided die. There are many electronic versions available if you dont have a d6 easily accessible.A place to accrue Taboo marks.This can the corner or back side of a page, an index card, a sticky note, or a bowl to hold glass beads. The important thing is to know how many Taboo marks you have accrued.

I believe in paying people for their work. This game is priced at $3, but if that isn't something you can do right now, in the spirit of Faerie bargains, send me an email (dawnbeargames at gmail) and I'll send you a copy. It will come with the caveat, thatif you play it, just let me know you played it. No need for a review or feedback (though I would love feedback), just to know that you played it. I won't promise to get you the game immediately, but I will likely get back to you with in a couple of days. </p></li>

<p>Brendan Keogh's Putting Challenge is a Pico-8 golf game about the parts of golf that other videogames cut out. Put the ball on the tee yourself. After hitting the ball, manually walk to where the ball went before you hit it again. If the ball goes in the water, put down another ball! Remove your ball from the hole before moving on to the next hole. If you run out of balls, return to the Pro Shop to get more balls. This is a golf game with unprecedented interactivity!!
Sounds tedious? It sort of is! But's it's also kind of relaxing, and it draws attention to just how edited and montaged most golf games are in their focus on the 'interesting bits'. Here, the 9-hole course is a single, unified experience.
I've crafted one big world, ten screens by ten screens. Within that world is a golf course of 9 holes. You are free to explore and walk around the course, and can complete holes in any order you want.
Ideveloped this game in Pico-8. It was a whole lot of work to get a game of this scale and complexity to fit in a Pico-8 cart, and I'm really proud of the quality of this final product.

Wait, why does this game cost $1??
This is the first time I've set a minimum price for one of my games. All my other games are small, quick, slapdash things. While this game is still quite small, I also put a considerable amount of work into it over the last few weeks, and I think it's important to not contribute to the devaluation of videogame labour. So I thinkit's worth paying a single dollar for.That's less than you'd pay for a single round ofTime Crisis 2!
You also get any additional courses I release in the future for free. I've already released a second 9-hole course!

So what do I get?
$1 unlocks a zip file within which you will find two versions of the game: a Pico-8 cart that you can run in Pico-8, if you own a copy of Pico-8; and a HTML5 version of the game you can run in any browser if you don't own Pico-8. (Note:Chrome has issues with audio since an update earlier this year. There's workarounds in the readme file. Or just use a different browser.)

BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE!!!
Multiple people on Twitter joked that they would pay for golf buggy dlc. WELL GUESS WHAT SUCKERS:
 
That's right, if you pay $2 for CHAMPIONSHIP EDITION, you get an exclusive day one dlc golf buggy! Zip around the golf course up to 4x faster!! Wow!

<p>Void Wisp is an ambient arcade runner where you earn points by coming close to obstacles without crashing. 

	You are a wisp. A collection of random energy that has coalesced into a sentient form. You float through the great nothingness that permeates existences, skimming off aether from the whatever that is nearby.


	The gameplay is simple. You have two buttons; one moves you up and the other lets you glide. Typically you'll be holding the glide button to slow your descent when an obstacle comes near so you can grind along the top or bottom for points. The closer you are the more points you'll earn. You'll crash if the center of the Wisp contacts an obstacle.


	Below is a short overview of how this game works.
	





 Features:
Simple gameplay thats easy to pick up and hard to master. Designed for both short spurts and long sessions.4 Game Modes each with a unique twist.
In Classic Mode youll start to lose points the farther you go, so you want to get as many as quickly as possible.In Caravan Mode you have one minute to score as much as possible. Crashing will lower the amount of time you have.Survival Mode is the most complex mode. A timer is always ticking down but can be refilled by collecting luster and having a high multiplier. The game gets faster and you earn more points the further you make it.In Traveler Mode there are 40 premade levels each with 5 goals to complete. You will face unique obstacles not found in the other modes.Accessibility options that let you customize the games looks, controls, and difficulty.
You can change the appearance of the game and character to better suit what makes you comfortable.Supports mouse, keyboard, and gamepad. All with fully remappable controls!Dreamy ambient music that partially reacts to how you play.</p></li>

<p>To find our way home, we must sift through the ruins and our memories of the Empire. But in our remembering, we must not forget what we have created for ourselves.
Orichalcum is a tabletop roleplaying map game for 1-5 players. Players will lay out a map of theEmpire that oppressed their ancestors and drowned in a deluge of its own making. By remembering what was left behind, they will draw a connection from the past to the present. Their people, theExiles, have evolved past theEmpire's ways, and these differences will become features on each player's map of their island home. Orichalcum is a game about drowning empires and imagining utopias.
This game was created for the Mapemounde game jam (#mapemounde2019) on itch.io, hosted by Mammut RPG.

<p>Winner of the Human Human Machine award at A MAZE 2017!
Word After Word is a fast-paced local multiplayer word game that uses a massive natural language dataset to reward players for thinking naturally about common word usage and context. The game is played by two to four people, each with their own keyboard. Each player is given the same randomly generated series of adjectives one at a time. For each adjective, each player tries to identify the noun that most commonly follows it (e.g. fast CAR). Each player is given a score based on how often their noun follows the given adjective in a dataset compiled from over a half a billion words taken from magazines, tv, and books. For each prompt, there are potentially thousands of correct answers of varying degrees. As an example, lets say players were given the word traditional. In the dataset, there are approximately 2000 nouns that would be accepted and scored. High scoring answers would be: role, family, and music.</p></li>

The world of Rosarah is haunted by the ancient past. Grand civilizations fell to the iron fist of the Kithen Empire. The people suffered. But while the empire fell over 1,000 years ago, the guardians who protect Rosarah are dwindling.

They are the Librarians: the guardians of ancient knowledge and history, protectors of the 8 magic spell books which were originally used by evil to conquer Rosarah. In The Last Librarian, you play as Randel, who is thrust suddenly into his role as a Librarian when his grandfather is slain by an undead monster. You must unseal the spells, buried deep in well-guarded Libraries, in order to defend Rosarah once again from tyranny.

Features:
Explore the vast and detailed world of Rosarah. The game is open-world, so you can play the way you want in the order that you want to do it. As you explore, discover tons of secret treasure, collectible upgrades, and interesting places and people.Learn the deep story of Rosarah, of its dark history and present trials. Encounter the villain throughout and the people who help in the fight against him. There is complex lore to find in the world, detailed characters, and a growing stake in the conflict.Uncover the secrets buried in the hidden Libraries. Throughout Rosarah, there are 8 distinct and varied dungeons, each with their own mechanics, multi-layered puzzles, and rewards.Battle 14 powerful and challenging bosses, and tons of other fun enemies, using a huge variety of strategies and magical weapons and abilities.

The game is designed to be especially challenging, a far-cry from the traditional Nintendo Zelda experience. There are between 10 and 20 hours of play-time total depending on how many secrets you seek to collect, and how skilled you are.
[Note]There are keyboard controls (configurable), however a controller is recommended for the best experience.
This game is available on Windows 10.A Linux compatible version will be available earlyJanuary 2020.

Frequently Asked Questions
Q -So, what this game is about?A -Towayami is essentially a horror adventure game.I won't spoil too much about its story, but you'll have to explore, find and use items, solve puzzles... and survive.Oh... and you'll also be immersed in darkness. All the time.
Q -I got it. It's as if I'm playing through the eyes of a blind person. Do I have any visual clues to help me out?A -No, you don't. It's pitch black, so you'll have to make use of the four other senses available to the main character.Mainly touch and sound, but you'll also get to know when something smells or tastes "different".Anyway, your brain will soon get used to this condition and will start filling the gaps by creating visual references where, in fact, there are none.Just like when you happen to wander in the dark in real life.
Q -Do I at least get a tutorial?A -During the first part of the game, even if you won't find any "hand in hand" guide in it, you'll have all the time and relatively safe areas to learn how to play.At first you'll be confused about who you are and what you have to do, but just by touching and examining your surroundings, you'll soon get enough information to understand all the important bits of the story.
Q -Hey, what's the deal with that black screenshot?A -You know, taking meaningful screenshots from a game where the main feature is the absence of any graphics... was quite challenging. (_;)
Q -What was your main inspiration to make this game?A -After I made "Five minutes a day", I kept thinking about how that short "graphicless" experience could've been expanded into a proper adventure game.Coming up with a good story and a smooth gameplay wasn't a quick and easy task, so this game became a sort of "secret project" I kept working on in between my other releases.Obviously, as previously stated in my other works (like with "The hair in the wall"), one of my biggest ispirations is Junji Ito and his works.Many of his stories resonate really strong with Towayami.
Q -One last advice?A -Only one? I'll give you three: keep your ears open, touch everything, and remember to use the "light touch" (right click) to examine things in a safe way.

<p>Imagine you're the most popular kid in school.So popular, in fact, that you're dating every single person in your class. The only problem? You've decided to break up with all of them,one by one.Heartbreak Highis an arcade-style spin on visual novels and dating simulators that asks you tobreak upwith all of your high school sweethearts instead of woo them. A single play-through can be completed in one 20-40 minute sitting, with each break-up featuring a unique branching story path and lovable (or unlovable?) characters for you to crush beneath your feet over and over again.If you couldn't already guess, it won't be easy. There's only 40 minutes until the end of the school day, and on top of that you must be careful not to act too cruel, too sexy, too selfish, and more... sometimes you'll have to stay tactful and sympathetic, while other break-ups will call for a somewhat firmer approach. It's as stressful as the real thing, baby!!!! And that's not even mentioning the various surprises and obstacles that'll get in your way!!!!

features:
over 15 unique choose-your-own-adventure-style break-up encounters (any less than that wouldn't have been stressful enough)multiple playthroughs encouraged - try saying something different next time because there's some wild stuff in therenearly everything on screen is hand-drawn (including the typeface and menus even!) which i think is very impressive don't you??an extensive original soundtrack by Ronnie Dezsi that brings every character (and menu screen) to lifevery funny writing (i know that's subjective but it's also definitely true in this case, sorry)there's a bunch of mini-games!!! they're like little tiny games inside of the bigger game, if you can believe itlots of fun characters that are cute and might make you sad to break up withit's a cheap quick game that doesn't take very long to play!!! it respects your time!!! isn't that nice!!!i made this game almost entirely by myself! my name's Alec Robbins! hello!there's a FREE PLAY mode where you can't lose but you also can't get to the final level. it's also good for role-playing without penalty!you can get chocolate in the game but you can't use it for anything. i should have taken that out of the game actuallya surprise ending... not allowed to say more... my apologies for even bringing it up in the first place...maybe you can even choose NOT to break up with them??? would that give you a different ending??? maybe??? hmm???

<p>Cell Tune is a life simulation game. You design creatures on a microscopiclevel and let them fight with other organisms.
Building your creatures is easy: There are five different cell types that you can combine in any way you want. But designing an organism that can strive is not quite so simple. You have to consider the level layout and many different construction tradeoffs: Little organisms can reproduce very fast, but are also quickly eaten by bigger ones. Aggressive creatures can decimate your enemies, but they are also more likely to digest their own children by accident. And you probably dont want an organisms that just swims against a wall all the time.
The game has a tutorial, 12 levels and a level editor. The level editor can be used for local multiplayer.

FAQ:
Why is there no kick drum like I was promised in the trailer?
Unfortunately I had to remove the kick drum because it made the music click and pop sometimes. But the good news is that the game will be 50% off, as long as I don't get around to include the kick drum again. Yay!

This makes me sad.Is there a way to turn the kick drum back on?
Rejoice! There is a way to turn it back on. Just install PureData, then go tomedia/PureData/pd_cellTune_nik2.pd, then go to menuMusic -> drums and connect pd kick with pd submixer drums.

Wait, does this mean I can change up the music system in any way I want?
Yes, it does. The possibilities with this are endless! (same thing applies to the graphics btw)

Will there be a Steam version?
No plans for that. The game will probably stay an itch.io exclusive. If this games will sell a million copies I might reconsider.

I have a very great idea for this game!
That's cool, I always like to hear new ideas. But I won't be able to implement them, as I don't have time right now. If anybody wants to take over development with this get in contact with me and I will sell you the rights to the source code ;)

This game made me realize that complex behaviorcan emerge from quite simple rules. Can I use this game to build a human creature having a real soul?
Glad you ask. It might be possible. But please consider the ethical implications before you do so!

Forge history. Throw coins to find out if the country resists an invasion, is overthrown by rebellion or falls into ruin in the Queen's absence. 
Homecoming.The Queen returns to the country, discover how the country has changed while she has been gone and how her homecoming is received.


Two player variant.The game also includes a small two player variant where you post letters to a friend. The game ends with an in person meeting when your friend comes to your house to finish the story.

<p>Most know of magic, and many will know a few small spells that help them through daily life - perhaps a ritual to ease a fever, or a rite to keep a drink warm. Dear reader, as you will learn from these pages, the world of magic is much more fundamental to society than these mundane cantrips.
  The Tome of Rites and Rituals is a roleplay aid designed to help spice up tabletop settings, grant inspiration to creatives, and provide an entertaining window into a fantasy world. The tome contains descriptions of 8 spells in the form of instructions, as well as a glossary for fictional plants, elements, drinks, and creatures  mentioned therein.

<p>The game includes 3 GAME MODES: story, random and survival to provide a high replayability. Explore a large 19th century city. Can find everything necessary to achieve your goal?
Gameplay:
~ horror ~ exploration ~ survival horror ~ run from monster | Slenderman-like
Setting:~ streets of London ~ open world~ 19th century | Victorian Era ~ cultists ~ demonic creature
Story: ~ 1849, Great BritainAfter a malevolent cult enjoyed a continueing growth of popularity, it became a threat to all people who did not share their philosophy. In 1845, the cult had taken control by force over several city districts or even whole villages throughout Great Britain. Now, a priest is declared to sneak into one of those reprobated cities to finish a task, that multiple people had failed accomplishing before. Thats were our story begins...
What is Grime & Gaslight about?Your task is to bless twelve crosses with holy water (for story and random mode). Therefore you have got three phials, each containing one charge for a blessing. You have to carefully look around in the city for these crosses and stoups, since you need to refill your phials. 
This game challenges your memory and orientation. Where have you been before? Where do you saw the last cross, you were not able to bless, since you hear something right behind you and had to keep going? Decide wise, when its time to spend holy water on a cross, for its your only defense against the unholy creature that crawls through the streets.</p></li>

We all know the scene, a group of Cowpokes gathered around a poker table, putting more than just money on the line. Their hopes, futures, burdens, and even their lives are often in the pot. A mix of fate and skill will determine what their next chapter will be if they even have one. But honestly? Despite the risks, at least they can say they tried; that they put it all on the line for a dream of a better life. And now, dear reader, its our turn to do the same.
Dream At High Noon is a poker based Tabletop Role-playing Game,focused on telling stories in the cowpoke fiction genre. It uses the mechanics and feelings of playing a game of poker to create an atmosphere reminiscent of the genre, empowering everyone at the table to take part in telling a story as a group that fits within the tropes and genre of cowpoke fiction.
So, will you play your cards right, even when fate deals you a bad hand, or will they come tumbling down around you? Will High Noon see your dream come true, or will this be your final dawn?

<p>The necromancer shrieks with cruel laughter, plunging the glowing dagger into the warrior's heart. Armor and bone tear like paper before the might of The Cursed Dagger of Ag'tekk. As the blood drains from the wound, Taft gloats, "Fool! All your struggle was for naught. Your soul will be but a tasty morsel for my dark master!"
He starts to pull the dagger out, but finds his wrist stopped cold by Francesca's iron grip. She stares back with an icy glare. Taft stammers, "IImpossible! I caught you right in the heart!" A glint of light catches the necromancer's eye, and he looks down to see the talisman of protection. "But that means..."
Wresting the dagger from the necromancer's cold hands, Francesca grins. "That's rightI hid all my vital organs in a pocket dimension!" Taking a free hand to dip a finger in what appeared to be blood, she tastes it and chortles. "You wasted the ichor of Ag'tekk on nothing more than a large ketchup packet!"

<p>An adventure fantasy RPG inspired by many sources but largely Luke Pearson'sHildaseries and Hayao Miyazaki's films.
Intended for 2-6 players and a GM. Uses dice d6, d8, d10, d12, and d20.
There are two included documents: a black & white printable version of the core rules, and a color version of the bestiary (which I don't recommend printing unless you have lots of color ink). There's alsoa free document containingcolor character, reference, and GM sheets. The sheets can be printed in B&W without any loss of information.
There are stories hidden everywhere:on the table, and under it; in pillow forts, between floorboards, on park benches, beneath the ground, over uncomfortable green couches, and elsewhere.
This is a guide to finding those stories, an atlas detailing their locations, a treatise on tracking them through the harsh Arctic wastes, a grimoire of divining spells.
This is a book of hidden stories.</p></li>

"This is a book that I've been waiting for for a long time.Nearly everything about it is perfect. The chilling reality of what Parole is and what life is like there, the strange and lovable characters that make up the cast, the story which remains hopeful even when the world is collapsing, this book nails it." - Sam,TheReadingWriter

The city of Parole is burning. Like Venice slips into the sea, Parole crumbles into fire.The entire population inside has been quarantined, cut off from the rest of the world, and left to die - directly over the open flame. Eye in the Sky, a deadly and merciless police force ensures no one escapes. Ever. All thats keeping Parole alive is faith in the midst of horrors and death, trust in the face of desperation and their fantastic, terrifying, and beautiful superhuman abilities.Regan, silent, scaly stealth expert, is haunted by ten years of anxiety, trauma and terror, and hes finally reached his limit. His ability to disappear into thin air isnt enough: he needs an escape, and hell do anything for a chance. Unluckily for him, Hans, a ghostly boy with a chilling smile, knows just the thing to get one. It starts with a little murder.But instead of ending a mans life, Regan starts a new one of his own. He turns away from that twisted path, and runs into Evelyn, fearless force on stage and sonic-superheroic revolutionary on the streets. Now Regan has a choice - and a chance to not only escape from Parole, but unravel the mystery deep in its burning heart. And most of all, discover the truth about their own entwining pasts.They join forces with Evelyns family: the virtuosic but volatile Danae, who breathes life into machines, and her wife Rose, whose compassionate nature and power over healing vines and defensive thorns will both be vital to survive this nightmare. Then theres Zilch, a cool and level-headed person made of other dead people, and Finn, one of Paroles few remaining taxi drivers, who causes explosions whenever he feels anything but happy.Separately theyd never survive, much less uncover the secret of Paroles eternally-burning fire. Together, they have a chance. Unfortunately, Hans isnt above playing dirty, lying, cheating, manipulating and holding Regans memories hostage until he gets his way.Paroles a rough place to live. But theyre not dead yet. If they can survive the imminent cataclysmic disaster, they might just stay that way</p></li>

<p>I was once watching a certain beloved show about a sentient creek. When I brought it up at work, someone mocked me. I quickly shouted at them"YOU WOULDN'T LAST ONE MINUTE ON THE CREEK". This brewed in my skull for years.. Now I offer you a TROIKA! compatible version of this experience. So uh.. roll up a character with the background of choice.
This is a cosmic dread simulator, that could also function as a funnel. Maybe you're playing a game and you need a duel and someone shouts "YOU WOULDN'T LAST ONE MINUTE ON THE CREEK"... ya.. now u kno what will happen.You could also use it as a quick way to level up your TROIKA! characters.It's also totally functional as a 1 player game.let me know in the comments how many seconds you make it on the creek... maybe we'll make a leaderboard. Currently a pickup truck made it 10 seconds before taking a frisbee to the face and being sent to its doom in the creek.

<p>The forest stands old. When the fog rolls in at dusk, and the boots of mailed adventurers crush stems and ferns, these trees uproot. Not quenched by rain or river, the forest drinks the blood of its invaders. This forest is old, full of memory, and anger.
You stand, within the core of ancient aspen or old oak, feeling the flow of sap in spring and the frozen silence of icy winter. As the forest breathes, you burn the bones of those who sought to carve through. Cruel dryads, all, you and your fellow spirits spire upwards toward the light of stars, and score the stone beneath your roots with deep cracking force.
And one day hatred walks in your domain. Fire and steel assails wood and stone as armored knights, gnarled wizards, and shrike sharp rogues bring death with them. Passing through wood like doors you emerge, recondite and wielding blades of razor thin fern. You defend the woods. And for now the intruders melt into the dirt and you sleep once again. If a hate-filled heart screams in the forest and no one is around to hear it, does it still make a sound?
Full of Memory And Anger is a meditation game of time and stillness, interrupted by brief scenes of ecological retribution. You play fae creatures living in the heartwood of old growth trees, dispensing asymmetrical retaliation to intruders in your realm. These intruders may bring with them evil and hate. They may be powerful fantasy adventurers, formidable masters of industry, or indiscriminate agents of chaos and pollution. You will always crush them in terrifying ways.
This game is inspired by The Skeletons by Bully Pulpit Games. It is a game of answering questions, but more importantly it is a game of silence and of waiting.</p></li>

<p>There is no bottom.
Every run ends in death.
Dive again.
Dive into Probability 0, the eternal descending platformer with roguelike tendencies.
I designed this game for myself:
Freely explore wildly different builds along a static skill tree. Chase the abilities that excite you. Try something different next time.Each run strives to deliver a new experience. Your enemies spawn at strange and varied rates.Each run strives to deliver a reliable experience. The game is focused on one thing: your struggle to survive a threatening landscape & its inhabitants.Everything that lives in the pit is designed to be dangerous and unique.As you go deeper, the game goes through pulsating waves of increased difficulty.Things get very different after 1km. (I rarely get this far. Honestly, the game may be a bit too hard? But if you're into that kind of thing, it's so satisfying to overcome the uncompromising obstacles that stand in your way.)
Listen to:
The layered soundtrack that shifts as the pit reveals itself to you.The siren that screams as danger mounts.An album full of remixes.https://queenjazz.bandcamp.com/album/probability-zero-remixed</p></li>

<p>When you first meet againneither of you remember what happened but what are these strange feelings? This intense sadness or longing out of nowhere? Maybe one you remembers something, but not the other. Maybe you remember different things? Then, as you interact more, you both start to remember. Every time you touch you see a significant moment from your past.Even if you try to pass it off as nothing, it becomes impossible to ignore.
You knew each other, and loved each other, a lifetime ago.
The question is, what are you going do about it in this life?
This is a gamefor at least 2 players, written for the #YourMoveJam

You will tell the histories of the weapons you carry as you surrender them, one by one, before entering the presence of a powerful ruler. Use a combination of dice and Tarot cards to build your reputation while revealing your true intentionsor keeping them hidden until the moment is right.

<p>CLT is an arcade shooter where enemies learn behaviours from those that went before  WebGL Demo  Win/Mac/Linux Versions
Wait, What Is It?
Central Limit Theorem is a survival shooter where you have to protect your core for as long as you can from the shapes attacking it. It's a quick, simple, stressful, high-score shooter designed to be played between other, more substantial games.
Each enemy starts with a unique behaviour (they can shoot, weave, or orbit) and they each leave a different coloured ink on the playfield. When another enemy crosses this ink later it will learn the behaviours of those that went before!The more ink, the more difficult the game becomes!
* IDGA Scotland Community Choice Award (Edinburgh Winner 2018) *
How Do I Play It?
[Fire] - Ctrl/Space[Pause] - ESC/P (Use 'P' above as ESC does some odd things with the web player!)[Rotate] - Arrow Keys/WASDA tutorial will play the first time you run the game. It can be played again by shooting the 'Help' button. Shoot the 'Play' button to start a game!Protect your core for as long as you can, and aim for a high score!
Why Should I Buy It?
Beyond supporting me and encouraging me to make more games, if you buy the game, you'll get a proper, customisable Unity-style executable for Windows, Mac, and Linux. This will allow you to have: Higher resolution and different aspect ratios! Better anti-aliasing for smoother graphics! The ability to easily save a picture of any run by shooting the 'Photo' button A 'secret' bonus alternative game mode! (Try shooting things in the main menu) Probably much better performance!
ATTENTION: The design might cause some difficulties for any of you lovely people with colour perception issues. Please try the demo and check out the screenshots before buying to make sure you won't be disappointed! I believe the game is still playable, but it might be more difficult!
LINUX USERS: Linux graphics drivers and Unity don't seem to play 100% nicely together, even when using 64-bit Ubuntu 12.04 or newer (the supported Linux OS from Unity). Testers reported running in fullscreen causes occasional problems, but that windowed mode runs fine. Your mileage may vary! 
When Was It Made?
I couldn't get along to the Global Game Jam 2018 (#GGJ18), but I decided to create something within the same time frame. The theme was 'transmission', so I allowed enemies to transmit their behaviours to each other via ink! Since then loads of new features and polish have been added to Cental Limit Theorem!

<p>
Im just tired of everything... even the echoes.There is nothing in my life but echoes...Echoes of lost hopes and dreams and joys.Theyre beautiful and mocking.
L.M. Montgomery, Anne of Avonlea
In time,everyone fades away,transfiguring intoechoes that latchonto our memoriesand bleed our hearts dry.
Barbara Garay, Beneath the Surface: A Book of Poems
__________________________________________________________
Echoes is a game about atonement or damnation. A game about fear and the obscure and resilience in the face of adversity both physically and mentally. You will explore the suppressed and repressed aspects of your mind and either project them into your new reality or deny them by projecting them into others.
You are a lone soul lost in a mysterious town searching for what remains of a loved one who has long since gone beyond the world. Mysterious creatures roam the mists surrounding the city, turning it into a cage, and supernatural forces rule over the streets and alleys. The echoes of your past latch onto you and challenge you at every turn.
You are alone.
You are afraid.
You are without hope.
Maybe if you survive, you'll learn something about your true self.
__________________________________________________________
Echoes is a solo journaling game where you write or record your story, using only a six-sided die and a deck of cards which provide prompts to get your mind engaged. You may get attacked during the night, recall memories from you and your loved one's past, or answer deep questions about your own morality. Echoes is deadly--but you can also add a block tower to make the deadly even deadlier.
__________________________________________________________
Disclaimer: There are themes of death, gore, violence, loss of agency and mental degradation that some players may find disturbing. Discretion is advised. Themes are heavily influenced in horror genres such as Silent Hill and Resident Evil.
This game was created as part of theWretched & Alone Jam, a game jam organised to coincide with the release of the SRD for theWretched & Alonesystem, based on Chris Bissette's gameThe Wretched.

<p>"Well, you're an odd fellow but you write a good game" - Erika Chappell
Look, some people have good, reasonable solutions to their trivial problems.
Some people are boring.
Steamed Hams is a game about having excellent, ridiculous solutions to your problems and escalating wildly until you find an excellent, ridiculous solution that works. It's one page long, designed for oneshots, and plays quickly.
It is meant to emulate the eponymous Simpson's episode or shows like Blackadder.</p></li>

<p>Once upon a time
There was a prince on a mission to save a princess from the hands of a terrifying dragon.
This prince, however, wasn't very brave, so his father ordered a witch to enchant a sword. 
This magical sword had a will of its own and was, unlike the prince, brave and wise.  Together they embarked on an adventure of a lifetime.
A fairytale with a twist!
You
play as the sword of the prince. Everyone in the land thinks the
prince is brave and adventurous, but in reality his magical sword is
all that.
Use your mouse to help the knight go through
dangerous environments.
Defeat enemiesAvoid spikes Slay
the dragon Save the princess!
Don't like reading?

No
worries. You write the story by playing it. Ooh, and if you do
let the prince die, we'll just tear out that page!
Controls
You
only need your mouse!

You
control the sword with your mouse by moving it around. The prince
will follow the sword, unless he is scared. Which happens more often
than not. Because the prince is afraid of a lot of things. His
fears include spikes, birds, green blobs, moles, heights, first
dates, germs, fire and of course dragons!

By
holding the right mouse button near the prince you can drag him to
safety while he shivvers in his armor.
You can also spin and
swing the sword with the left mouse button to hit enemies or deflect
projectiles.
What can you expect from this game?
 2 hours of gameplay! 25 levels Experience what it's like to be a sword</p></li>

<p>The world is ending around you and youre trying to make your way to some place you consider safe. Youre not sure if it is safe but youve heard rumors.
As The World Ends... probably wont end happy. It isnt meant to. Its a chance to explore things we normally dont allow ourselves to. Things we hide. Things we cling to. Moments we live for. Sadness. Regret. Hope. This is about hoping against hope. By the end, you may have nothing physical left. But you might have some feelings that you finally dug into and examined.

<p>"There are two kinds of people in the world, is what I think.
There are 'normal' people. Those people smile and talk easily, look people in the eye and laugh. Those people walk right up to strangers and talk to them, and come away as friends. They smile, they feel things, and they're just... Destined to be surrounded by people, it seems. They'll be successful and happy and loved.
And then there are other people, who are like me.We don't talk that easily.We don't even feel very much.
At least, I don't."
Megumi Shimizu's life is routine and monotonous. Get up, go to school early, fulfill her duties as class leader, try to deal with Inoue, and go home and do it all again tomorrow. She has no friends, her life doesn't seem like it'll go anywhere...and she's fine with that.
She's used to it, just like she's used to the cold, numbing winters in her hometown of Ikigai.
Then one day, a new transfer arrives. A new transfer who is instantly liked by her classmates and teacher, who is everything Megumi is not. Bubbly, sweet, happy, social.And for some reason, this new girl, Hinata Mikami, thinks Megumi is nice and wants to be friends. And Megumi is stunned to find she likes Hinata too...
Little by little, Megumi's cold and unfeeling world sounds less and less appealing.

<p>There is a monument at the edge of civilisation, an enigmatic object known as Chirons Doom. Nobody knows what it does, or who made it, or why. It has defied all previous attempts at understanding. Countless expeditions have torn themselves apart trying to learn its secrets.
Theres no reason to think your expedition will be any different, but here you are. Three more explorers standing before the monument, driven to try where all others have failed. How much are you willing to sacrifice to solve the mystery of Chirons Doom?

Chiron's Doom is a storytelling game inspired by gothic sci-fi anddark fantasy tales of unknowable monuments, doomed expeditions, and explorers too driven (or foolish)to know when to turn back. Each flip of a cardbrings the hope of new discoveries, but dangers multiply as the expedition wears on. Play to find out if any of your explorers can defy fate and finally learn the truth.
All you needis a deck of ordinary playing cards, a journal to record each day's setbacks and breakthroughs, and (optionally) one or two other players.</p></li>

This gameseems super-fun and enables good banter and drama. You want to try that!

And seriously, you need to read all that before you try that?Come on, you don't even know if you like to play roleplaying games! You just want to try it.
I wrote this game for you.

Ruby Radiance was designed to be an entry point for newcomers, your gateway into roleplaying. It is meant to be accessible, low-commitment, and easy to learn. It is not meant to emulate any Hasbro product or the trappings of OSR; instead, it focuses on the modern podcasting and streaming media. We know you come into the hobby with certain expectations and this game was designed to provide those.
Every element of Ruby Radiance has been adjusted to bring the same exactly type of drama and hijinks you may have enjoyed in other media. T
Features of Ruby Radiance:

Streamlined systems that help new players to organisegames organically, from individual characters to massive campaign arcs.

But wait! There is more.
100 community copies of the game will be made available for someone else to pick it for FREE. These are meant for those experiencing poverty and/or of marginalised communities.For each copy of this game sold, I will be adding an additional free financial copy.
The game is listed as "in development" as a promise. If this experience works, if people are getting into the hobby this way, I want to keep developing this game. Iwill release more content to Ruby Radiance AND keep working on more projects. I would love to get a co-op going around this work, do more writers, hire more people to expand content, and damn right I would love to expand the Roaring Valley into a full-blown setting!
This is the Zine edition of the game. The next edition of the game (Quest)Whwill include streamline to the rules, as well as feedback. Additionally:

<p>Your actions define you. When you choose to solve problems with empathy before brawn, how does that shape who you become? How does that change the world around you?
Praxis Arcanumis a deckbuilding roleplaying game for 2 to 6 players,focused on the co-creation of characters and setting through play. In Praxis, players create a troubled fictonal world they will explore through the eyes of a character that hasnt yet come into their own. Who that character becomes depends on each players choice of actions, and how those actionsimpact the world.
Praxis starts by collaboratively designing a custom world featuring an abnormal power called The Weird. The Weird can range from mutant superpowers, to elements of magic, to the existence of paranormal entities. Whatever you decide it is, the Weird has significantly shaped the world and the characters within it.
The details of this custom world will be written on a deck of cards. New cards are added to the deck to reflect the players exploits and discoveries. Similarly, each player has their own deck made up of cards describing their characters passions, skills, and powers.
Your character's thoughts, skills, and powers exist as cards in your hands, to be played when needed.Characters learn from each action they take as they struggle throughstories of self-discovery. Play to discover your character's changing personalities, abilities, and desires through their actions.
At the core of Praxis Arcanum is this simple principle: your actions define you, whether you make them whimsically, or out of dire necessity.
The world is your own. Who will you become?

Build Your Own Custom Character

<p>It emits a signal and passes from one scene to another. Whether with an AutoLoad or any node, change scenes and choose the transition that you like
Three shaders are included for transitions of type cut, pixelation and simple fade in/out.12 different transitions so far.




To install this asset in your project you just have to:
Pass the shaders folder to the root of your project.Move the cutoff_d folder to the "assets" folder within your project ".Pass the "Transitions" folder into your "scenes" folder at the root of your project. If you require the "change_scene()" function, paste the "autoload" folder in the root of your project and add the scene as AutoLoad in the project settings.
How to use:
If in your main scene you have a node that instantiates the levels, called "Levels" or something similar, instantiate the scene that is in the "Transitions" folder in your main scene. The first property is to select the transition you want and the second property is to indicate the path of the node that instantiates scenes.


When your character enters the area of a door or something, it emits a signal to the root node of the level and this in turn will emit the information to its root node, which is the Game Node.
The "scene" parameter is something like this: "res: //scenes/levels/lvl_1.tscn"


In the Game node, the root of everything, there is a variable that directs us to the node we just instantiated for transitions.



If you have the scene of transitions like AutoLoad, simply add these lines every time you want to change the scene:

If you need more transitions you can comment, probably make updates constantly.


You can send an email to "contacto [ar] indielibre.com" if you need help implementing the asset in your project.

<p>Throughout your life, throughout generations of your family, throughout the various fronts of your war, you have had one great rival. Again and again you clash with them, one walking away the victor of the battle, but bearing the scars of your war.
A Duet Of Steel is a game about Rivals who engage each other in charged exchanges over an extended period of time.
Two philosophers who trade barbs in public arguments and diatribes over decades.
Neighboring nations spend their youths in pitched battles for shifting fronts and alliances with vassal states on the stage of a protracted war.
Two rival paramours peacocking for the affections of the citys most eligible heir over a hot, thirsty summer.
Two criminal dynasties trapped in a bloody cycle of vengeance in their struggle for domination.
A pair of immortals diametrically opposed, going centuries without contact before violent confrontations.
Whatever the setting and scope, the focus of A Duet Of Steel is the two Duelists, their climatic duels, and the aftermath of these confrontations. The Duet Of Steel is a dance of antagonism, with an ebb and flow of conflict and recovery. But it is a Duet, with the two parties playing off each other. It takes two to tango.</p></li>

<p>This Party Sucks is a collaborative story game about being a queer and/or trans twentysomething who is (badly) processing a recent breakup. You will play out a piece of their story as they attend a series of three parties while trying (and failing) not to think about their ex. The game encourages a group of three players to laugh, wince, and (possibly) reflect on their own lives and relationships while telling their shared protagonist's story with honesty and tenderness.
This Party Sucks now features updated PDFs, one formatted for digital reading and the other a print-and-play zine format. This edition also has expanded gameplay tools built based on playtester feedback, including tips for creating a main character, determining themes and details of the game setting, and managing game tone if gameplay veers humorously or awkwardly close to players' own relationship histories. You can also access a random character generation tool I designed specifically for this game here.
Inspired by Mal Blum's queer folk punk album Tempest in a Teacup, and made for the ReCo2k19 game jam. The original game jam version and interim drafts are still available through Patreon for those who enjoy seeing the game's development arc.</p></li>

<p>Potato Thriller (Classic)is the original version (V1) of the game before making it onto Steam through the Steam Greenlight program. Originally launched April 1st, 2016,Potato Thriller started here on itch.io and was my very first commercial game release ever.After launching on itch, Isubmitted Potato Thriller onto Steam's Greenlight program. The game got mixed reactions however, mostly where positive and many users were willing to give my game a chance on the Steam platform. To my surprise, I receivedan email from Valve a couple weeks later telling me that my game was greenlit to be launched on Steam. Potato Thriller receiveda pretty impressive number of "yes" votes from Steam communityand I was filled with excitement and motivation. As a thanks, Icreated an updated special version of Potato Thriller just for Steamcalled: "Potato Thriller Steamed Potato Edition" which included many game enhancements, extra content and numerous game secrets. I have come really far as a game developer since this time and looking back at this game makes me realize what a silly and ridiculousproject it was. Idebated numerous times with myself if Ishould just delete if from itch.io but decided to keep it up forever as a reminder to myself. I realized that this game is such an important part of my history as a game developer and it shows how far Ihave come. It's an awkward, cringy and poorly made game with many faults. But it's also a game with a lot of heart and passion and i'm super proud of what I have created here and always will be. We all start somewhere and i'm proud to be able to say that Potato Thriller was my first "serious" game release.
Original description:
Known for deep frying his victims, Potato Man is the most notorious serial killer out there. After receiving an anonymous tip about the whereabouts of the Potato Man, bounty hunting team Quindalin and Dexter depart on a capture mission to put an end to the Potato Man once and for all. However, trying to capture this dangerous criminal might be the biggest mistake our heroes ever make...
"Potato Thriller" is an insane horror / thriller / action game with a crazy story-line and constant changing gameplay mechanics. Play as Quindalin, the best bounty hunter around. Explore the dark twisted world of the Potato man as you struggle to survive dangerous environments, encounter deadly enemies, meet strange characters, and come across many unexpected situations. Potato Thriller is a game filled with many surprises...

<p>This is not a horror game about things that jump out and scare you. This is a horror game about feeling lost and being worried about dying instantly to what's around the next corner.
This game does not care about what came before or what comes after. There is only the labyrinth.
This game has enemies that you cannot beat, only outrun. They are slow, they aren't smart, but they are patient, they are many, and they are powerful. Some will be very obvious with their presence, and some will blend in almost perfectly with their surroundings. Make sure to save when you have breathing room.

Note:There is an ongoing bounty where the first person to have video evidence that they've beaten this game will get every public project I have made and will make for free. I must emphasize that you should not feel bad for trying and failing, as this game (and most of my other games) is meant to be a test against the hubris of humanity.

[Side note: this game engine (Smile Game Builder) is not very flexible so just ignore most of the menu (assessed through the Esc key) and use it only to save your progress. Also, during my first test my antivirus forced it closed to scan it, so if it does that just the once for you please don't send bug reports about that; it's pretty out of my hands. Also, there is no soundtrack; I was listening to this playlist during most of development and I recommend it.]</p></li>

<p>You like stories, right? Of course you do, or else you wouldn't be here. I have a proposition for you - just hear me out for a second.
I just transferred to[REDACTED] Academy, a boarding school for the most elite and (occasionally) gifted students across the country. Today, February 12th, 2014, is my first day. Changing schools right in the middle of the year is tough, especially since the entire student council seems to want a piece of me,but that's not what I need your help with.
You see, someone in this school killed my father, and I won't stop searching until I find out who.

ABOUT
Who Killed My Father Academy!is a mystery romancevisual novel with heavy meta elementsabout fake-dating boys to find out who killed our enigmaticprotagonist's father. It features:
A branching narrative with5 character routes and1 "True" routeTwo endings per characterF/M, M/M, and F/FcontentAround 60,000words (Roughly 4-5 hours playtime)Classical music soundtrack using public domain recordingsName the protagonist!

CAST
There are 5 main characters of interest in WKMFA, each with their own route. Could any of them be the very culprit our protagonist is searching for...?
Well, that's what you're playing to find out, isn't it? I mean, you're the one here with the ability to use save states, not her.

<p>No Stone Unturned is a tabletop roleplaying game for 2-6 players. It's designed to play as a one-shot or short campaign, with sessions lasting from 2-4 hours each. Players will create characters and locations and take turns as the Arbiters of the world, meaning there is no set Game Master. 
The game starts with a collaborative worldbuilding exercise, after which you will make characters to live in the world and go on adventures to help. While adventuring, you will be rolling dice based on your character's abilities and also how they are feeling to determine the outcome of your actions. The "winner" of the action roll will get to add Details to the narrative and progress the story forward. 
You are about to create a story that features characters living in a world unrecognizable to our own. Their society is starting to pick up the pieces after yet another apocalypse. Natural catastrophes, manmade disasters, and maybe even external influences have caused collapse after collapse, but humanity has somehow hung on. Remainders of each of these civilizations and artifacts of their downfalls lurk hidden throughout the world. 
Enough time has passed that many settlements have stabilized and are now looking to expand and explore what is around them. The characters that you will play live in one of these settlements and are tasked with exploring the world around the settlement and acquiring what resources and knowledge that can be found. While that may sound like a noble cause, the world around them is populated by other societies, recovering wildlife, unstable ecosystems, and volatile remnants from disasters past. If these adventurers aren't careful, their actions will endanger their neighbors as well as their own homes

The full rules are available on the SRD, so feel free to read them there and play the game for free. The rules there are currently a couple of rounds of edits behind, but the core rules are the same. I will update it with the final text once complete. If you like reading the rules or playing from them, it would be really nice if you could rate the game here on itch. It'd help get more eyes on the project!
The game is nearly finished in this state, simply needing a final pass of copyediting and then I will add pdf accessibilty features and a pdf reader table of contents. Once that is finished we'll be printing out the zines for our kickstarter backers and selling some here as well!

Jude used to leap out of helicopters to rescue/protect people from terrifying infernos. Now, by day, he protects the local mall from rowdy teenagers who ride their skateboards inside. By night, he protects the the parking lot, and the rest of Portland, from undead, bloodsucking creatures of the darkness. Or would if he could find them.But hes just about ready to give it up (living with PTSD and pain from the traumatic event that cost him a leg, a friend, and a lot more is hard enough), when something crashes into his life. And his window.Its one of these creatures of the darkness  and hes a lot less scary than expected. More cuddly, with dark fuzzy wings, and neon-bright hair.His name is Pixie, and he refuses to bite anyone. Assault/murder/draining fluids isnt punk, even if being a vampire really kind of is. Hes very hungry by now, and the much bigger, meaner, deadlier vamps kick him around on the nightly. Jude would love to find and fight some actual undead bullies. And Pixie could use some help staying alive. Time to make a deal.Together they fight crime. And maybe even heal.Of course, life still sucks when youre a vampire who refuses to suck blood. Fortunately, theres a really interesting new barbecue restaurant in the mall, with an intriguing new recipe. (We hear that the secret ingredient is love. No, really.)</p></li>

<p>Une version franaise de cette page
Here we are! Grand Rapid Falls! The last race of an exhausting season of the Tour! The crazy, fast and dangerous races of recent months have been exciting to follow, but this race is the most beautiful, the most prestigious. Whoever wins it will be crowned Tour Champion!
This season, the Champion crushed the competition and won all the events. But her challengers all want to take her place in this final stage!
3.2.1. Let's go! The race is on! But don't forget that these drivers have had some great moments all season long (relive them on our dedicated channel!) and the final victory may not be the goal of all of them! The sidelines of the track, failures and successes, their relationships with other runners will impact their performance.
Will the Champion win the race? What impression will these Pilots leave? Who will we see again on the Tour? Who won't finish the race? All these answers (and more) in our live stream!

Final Lap is a role-playing game for 2 or more players (although it is possible to play it alone). Based on Alex Roberts' game For the Queen, and therefore Descended from the Queen, it takes the form of a deck of cards, which we'll draw as the game progresses. They'll help us create our story.

In addition to the deck of cards, we don't need anything but our imagination. A game lasts between 30 minutes and 2 hours, depending on the number of cards we use.
The rules of the game are written on the "Instructions" cards, which are revealed and read at the beginning of the game, and which explain us how to play.

Final Lap explores the world of racing and competition. We play the role of drivers in the last race of the season. The race that will determine the overall winner of the season. The Champion won everything this season and is the favourite. But we are her challengers and have an opportunity to beat her in this final lap.
During the game, we will be narrating live scenes, in the middle of the race as we approach the final lap. But we will also tell flashbacks about our past and what happened in previous races, between races or even before we entered the Tour. We will explore the relationships between Pilots and with the Champion.

Final Lap is available in a light version on the For The Drama platform (see also here on itch.io). You can play online with a version that offers a single ending where the Champion is sure to win. You can also use the platform to discover the game's questions and quickly try out the game.
The full game includes 9 game settings with different atmospheres:
Destruction Derby on tracks of all kindsPlane races in a pulp metropolisKids on soapbox carsBut also wizard races, post-apocalyptic rallies, bicycle races...



9 unique Champions are also available in the full game, each with their own card and style. It is also possible to use these Champion cards to quickly define your character.



Final Lap is available in PDF format for free, in a Print'N'Play version. The cards are adapted to MTG cards sleeves for comfortable use.
I recommend that you print the Back pages in Black & White, and the Front pages in colour.
For a purchase of $3 or more, the PDF with the Settings and Champions illustrated and in color will be added to your library. I may also add in the future a PDF with the tuck box for your deck of cards, to print and cut yourself. Additional cards may also come in the future.
The text of the game Final Lap is available under CC-By-SA and Beerware license.

<p>In 1955 the police station of Hopkinsville, Kentucky was swarmed by members of the families that shared a farmhouse just outside of the town. They reported that the house was under attack by extra-terrestrial creatures, but a police investigation only uncovered bullet holes and shattered windows, and evidence that the families were mostly drunk at the time of the incident. The aliens reported in the story became known as the Hopkinsville Goblins, and became an infamous local cryptid, though there were no reported sighting since. Experts believe that a combination of alcohol, a meteor sighting, and aggressive owls led to the supposed sighting. This game is inspired by that story, told from the perspective of the owls.
Hopkinsville Goblins are owls trying to scare off a group of drunk vacationers. The players are a group of outlaw owls hiding from the law in an abandoned building until a group of rowdy vacationers moved into the building and forced you out. Fearing discovery by owl law, you decide that your only option is to force them out using the same grift you used back in the day: alien impersonation.
This is a game for two to four players, with no GMs. The game is played in a series of six loosely-structured scenes. You need an eight-sided die and at least three six-sided dice to play.

<p>"Journeys begin and end; the story does not."
                                              -Old Mareman Proverb
Much of Marema was destroyed by the Empire of Garen decades ago. The radioactive fallout destroyed most of the tropical rainforests and verdant countryside for which Marema was famous, leaving behind only a desert waste known as The Deadlands. In the century following the war, the once proud country of Marema has fallen into a slow decline from which it may never recover, with recent efforts at peace with Garen having mixed results.Twenty years after The Reclamation, the people of Marema are beginning to venture out into the Deadlands once more, but tribalism and economic struggles have left the few settlements which remain in a precarious positionmeanwhile, the rest of the world continues on as it largely has, indifferent to the struggles of the Mareman people.
Now, just days before the signing of a bill granting land ownership to any brave soul willing to finish what The Reclamation began, two young adventurers prepare to claim their piece of the Deadlands, not realizing that they will soon be swept up in the latest chapter of a struggle that has been playing out for thousands of years; a war for the very future of mankind.
And it remains to be seen if they will survive the Volt Age...
------------------------------A DynamicWorld with a Rich History:
-As you explore the Deadlands you will meet many people who can be convinced to move back to your fledgling town of PedregalSprings.Once you have made a new friend or joined a faction, continue to check back as you grow in strength. Continue to help them and you could be rewarded with rare gear, discounted items, or even a new party member!
-Learn aboutthe history ofMarema, expose the dark secrets of The Reclamation, and uncover a vast struggle between mankind and the gods reaching back thousands of years.
-As you meet new allies and grow in strength, you will be able to interact with the world around you in many new and exciting ways. Pick locks, scrap old machinery, and use tools to take control of your surroundings.
A massive continent, begging to be explored...
A Story You Can Play at Your Own Pace:
-No quests to save the world at Level 5 here! Take your time learning the nuances of the world as you are eased into a story which grows and advances organically. Most towns will continue to offer new challenges long after you first discover them.
-Level grinders rejoice! Currently, new content will continue to unlock until Level 55, with future updates introducing new challenges aimed at partiesall the way up to Level 80. Most characters will continue to gain new abilities until the very end of the game, as well.
-Two very different paths await you! Save the world, seek the truth, and fight for what you believe...the choice is yours.

The story begins with two adventurers seeking to claim their piece of the Deadlands...
A Lively and Unique Cast of Characters:
-While some individuals seek to make the Deadlands a better place, many are motivated by money or personal desires.Meet a diverse cast of more than a dozen characters, each with their own reasons for choosing to help (or hinder) the protagonists.
-In addition to their normal abilities, your allies possess passive skills which will let you interact with the environment in new ways or even add unique buffs to the party!

The tech-savvy Nyla is able to locate valuables the party would otherwise miss...

An Experience Like No Other:
-Immerse yourself in an amazing soundtrack featuring works by Aaron Krogh, J.C. Brickston, Darren Curtis, and world-renowned composer Hiroki Kikuta!
-Battle against over 60 unique enemies, ranging from the simple Barrel Sludge to the terrifying Goni, with several hostile factions and nearly a dozen unique human foes to round out the threats your party will face. Face off against massive enemies which challenge your sense of scale: huge dragons, ancient spirits, and (if you're very unlucky) the mighty Bunyip!
-Nearly 400 pieces of gear ranging from swords and shields to sniper rifles and force fields means you can customize your characters to suit your play style. Find a brand of gear that suits your needs, or mix and match to maximize certain stats!

Unleash powerful abilities on deadly foes...
NewUpdates Already in Progress:
-Every new update will add new areas, introduce new characters, advance existing storylines, and (of course!) add new quests to complete. With the Version 4.1 Update "Doorways" finished, the final major update ("Journey's End") is slated for completion sometime later this year, and will draw the tale of Nolan and his friends to a close...

Each new update advances the main quest while opening new story lines...

<p>Explore forgotten worlds and deadly dungeons with your companions, make difficult choices and endure their consequences. Solve intriguing puzzles to open doors and obtain key artifacts. Have fun!

Story
Moonstone is a pretty mountain village that owes its riches to a famous mine, that has recently become a source of major trouble for the inhabitants. Since part of it caved in due to a misterious explosion, the village is haunted at night by dangerous creatures that have already caused one casualty: Terence the Baker. With your companions you decide to help the villagers (for a handsome reward of course as nobody works for free nowadays) to get rid of said monsters. What starts as a simple "cleaning operation" of the mines quickly evolves into an epic drama about lost civilisations, historic guilt, race disputes and difficult choices about loyalty, justice and trust. And yes, there is also a love story or two, depending on your choices.

What can you do in this game?
In 7 hours of gameplay you can enjoy interesting tales, play detective and solve a hideous crime, fight deadly enemies, solve intriguing puzzles, play minigames, win/lose your money at gambling, loot chests, trade, open a bank account, open doors with picklocks. Make tough choices with not always foreseeable consequences.
How will it end?
This depends entirely on your choices. There are three possible ends: happy end, bad end and death. Death means "game over" - you won't even have the doubtful pleasure of seeing the bad end ...

Free demo !  Play the first hour of the game for free!

<li><a href="https://schmidt-workshops.itch.io/anomalies">https://schmidt-workshops.itch.io/anomalies</a>
<p>Anomalies may be a game, then again it may not. One user described it as "A million musical leeches, waiting to suck the serotonin from my brain."
Another said "I don't even know what to say about this one. It honestly freaked me out a little."
A particularly enthusiastic user stated "Wish I had some kind of supercomputer to push the limits on this thing... I'm pretty sure it would reveal the secrets of the universe."
A Fine Art GameAnomalies is an experimental generative art game. There are no levels, points or objectives. It is a "game" in the loosest sense of being an amusement or pastime, an interactive piece of audio-visual, virtual sculpture, which one can tinker around with and explore.
Generate and ExploreYou can randomly generate the anomalies, or you can change the anomaly's parameters manually with a series of sliding dials in order to tweak your creation. Use the controls to explore Anomalies, and the unique sights and sounds they generate.
Sights and SoundsAnomalies are both audio and visual phenomena, the parameters that effect one effect the other. Some are strange and discordant entities, while others are symmetrical and harmonious. All the images and "songs" you hear in the demo video were produced through the program's algorithms.
Other OptionsUsing a built in screen capture button, you can collect snapshots of your handiwork. Use it as desktop wallpaper, or share it with your friends. If you want to revisit a favorite anomaly, you can also save it and load it again later. There is also an auto timer feature that cycles through anomalies automatically, allowing you to sit back and enjoy the show.
ExperimentalI call Anomalies "experimental" because of the way in which I developed it. I started with a simple idea - "what would trees look like if they grew in space?" - and began to create fairly simple, branching structures. Once that was working, I thought about different colors and textures. Each stage brought new questions and possibilities - "what if they move or wiggle? What it they make sounds? What if they produce flames or particles?" - and so on, until I arrived at what you see in the program. So I had no idea what it would end up like when I started it. Though I have moved on to other projects, I still think about more possibilities for Anomalies. I do hope to be able to return to working on this program at some point, but I will not give any promises right now...
Moddable AnomaliesIf you want to change things around, add your own sound effects, swap out textures etc... download the "Anomalies_Moddable.zip" and have at it!
For Backgrounds, the game looks at the following files:Space_Background_006.bmpSpace_Background_007.bmpSpace_Background_008.bmpSpace_Background_009.bmpSpace_Background_010.bmpThere are a few other background styles in there already. If you rename them to one of these (6-10) then they will appear in-game, if the background slider is set to the appropriate number. For whatever reason, 0 and 1 both correspond to "Space_Background_006.bmp", 2 to 007, 3 to 008, 4 to 009 and 5 to 010. It's not particularly logical, but it works :)

<p>"I want translations with copious footnotes, footnotes reaching up like skyscrapers to the top of this or that page so as to leave only the gleam of one textual line between commentary and eternity." - Vladimir Nabokov, author of Lolita and Pale Fire
-
This is a game about a Writer and a Translator who have every reason to be the dearest of friends or most vicious of enemies. Writer left their home1under great duress, bound for a foreign land; Translator, out of pity and admiration, supported them2 in their time of need. Now, Writer is working on their grand magnum opus3; Translator is appending their lines with footnotes to relay its deeper meanings or so they think.
The two are set on an inevitable collision course:
like hands reaching elbows in jocular embrace4;
  like armies marching grimly from their battle lines5;like skyscrapers6 blotting out the sun.
-
Like Skyscrapers Blotting Out The Sunis a 2-player game of friendship, disagreement, reconciliation, and, above all, writing (and the footnotes that define what's written).

1, left their home, the introduction is a fictionalisation of the author Vladimir Nabokovs complex emigration from Russia to the U.S.A. from 1917 to 1940.
  
2, supported them, referring to the U.S. literary critic Edmund Bunny Wilson, who became fast friends with Nabokov and helped him find work.
  
3, magnum opus, meaning great work, an enduring masterpiece that aims for or receives critical praise.
  
4, jocular embrace, referring to an entry in Nabokovs dream journal after his and Wilsons bitter falling-out over his translation of Pushkins Eugene Onegin: somebody on the stairs behind me takes me by the elbows. E. W. Jocular reconciliation.
  
5, battle lines, a double meaning referring to lines of text as well as military formations.
  
6, like skyscrapers, referring to Nabokovs demand for translations with  footnotes reaching up like skyscrapers to the top of this or that page while arguing for direct translations with notes rather than localised translations that change the writers original meaning to something familiar to the new audience.</p></li>

"You and your family are survivors. You survived the old world, you survived each other. Now I'm asking you to survive once again. We need to rebuild the world or we will be part of it's ruins. Yes, cities, communities, pretzels, laughs. We need a city to be citizens. We need houses to belong."

Before the Beginning is a game of scavengers and their families struggling to build a city in a post-apocalyptic world. You will face moral challenges and dangers of all sorts: witches, doomsday religious cults, cyborgs, mutants... everything to build a home, to belong somewhere. Once the city is built, you can finally rest. Until there, there's no room for cowards.

To build the city you must manage not just your character sheet but the city sheet. Don't fool yourself, finding the right objects can be harder than you think. A lot of families already died trying, you can bet. But I trust in you. I know this shelter will become a beautiful city and maybe our children will be the mayors of it someday. Let's hope for the best!


This game is avaliable in two languages, Brazilian Portuguese and English. Both are in A4 paper and have versions with and without bleed.

Hidden beneath the surface theres another layer to the world. Supernatural creatures roam the shadows, living among and integrating into society as humankind expands into every corner they used to have to themselves. It was only a matter of time, then, before they found their way into our hospitals.

Looking for help.

The Eldritch Care Unit is a medical program that runs alongside the mundane hospitals and medical centers throughout the country. You play those doctors, nurses, occultists, and other staff members that seek to do whatever they can to cure the supernaturally sick population, despite the difficulties of incomprehensive insurance, short-staffing, and lack of funding.

Its not easy to do this job. But you swore an Oath.

And its magically binding.
The Game
Eldritch Care Unit is a unique RPG taking place in the hidden supernatural wing that's present in hospitals across the United States, wherein players take on the roles of overworked doctors, nurses, ritualists, researchers, and other staff members, doing their absolute best to provide the care they can to the patients that come in. Said patients are inherently supernatural by nature or affliction, and so these rare specialists are the only ones who have a hope of fixing them up.
This book contains:
Information on the Eldritch World that these ECUs exist within.A unique new resolution mechanic, the Adversarial System, which relies on withstanding external hardships more than testing your own capability directly.Example patients and advice to get you started.A fillable character sheet.
ECU is also San Jenaro Co-op Approved, guaranteeing that it was produced in fair conditions by forward-thinking people!</p></li>

<p>A One-Player game for the #YourMoveJam
You are a ghost, and you cant even remember how you died. There are three living people who you know to be important to you in some way, but you dont know why. More important than anything, you have a message you must convey to one of them, but you dont know what it is.
You are unstuck in time, unsure of who you are, and unable to rest until youve figured out what your message is and delivered it.

<p>There Will Be Inkis a difficult tactical action game for 1-8 players. Play solo or with friends in battles between stick figure armies on a paper notepad, just like you used to draw in class instead of paying attention!
TWBI is a difficult game, where charging forward into the fray will rarely win a battle. Tactical thinking is essential. Assessing the battlefield, taking cover as needed, keeping an eye on troops positions: all of these are essential for winning the day. Or, if that sounds like a chore, switch to Arcade Mode and run & gun at will!
Tactical Depth
Although the theme and visuals might suggest otherwise, there is a lot of depth underlying these doodles. As units gain experience and level up during a battle, they become progressively more proficient at battle and will go prone to evade danger, hide behind cover when attacking, and dodge incoming rockets. Ranking up also increases various other attributes, such as stamina, ammo capacity, weapon accuracy, and even how quickly a unit will raise or lower a flag to take over a building. Actions such as running, rolling, and throwing grenades take stamina, and if a units stamina runs out they become exhausted and must wait a short period to catch their breath. Outside of battle, the player can use experience points earned during battle to unlock unit-specific and global training and weapon upgrades as well as HQ abilities like ammo drops, paratroopers, and air strikes.
Mission Variety
While some missions see you attack the enemy head on, others involve building up a base using engineers, rescuing prisoners behind enemy lines using a lone sniper, fighting against your own defecting forces, traditional "boss" fights, and even battling it out at sea (upcoming). In addition to the built-in campaign missions (39 and counting), There Will Be Ink includes a map editor to design your own battlefields from scrap as well as a campaign editor to string missions together into a full fledged campaign. Or, if you're not feeling creative, be sure to check out the "Quick Battle" option, which allows you to choose a few variables using sliders and toggles and then jump into a random map.
Persistent Battlefield
In There Will Be Ink, the history of any given battle is retained by the craters, shells, and red ink spilled on the battlefield, while end-of-battle stats are there to give you a more numerical analysis of the battle.Play With FriendsPlay with or against up to 7 friends in local multiplayer (or with a few friends online using Steam Remote Play Together). A team can play through a whole campaign together or just a quick battle or player-designed map. In campaign missions that were previously won, players can join the enemy team for an extra challenge (or not!). In addition to end-of-battle stats for players to compare, badges are presented to players for such feats as the most kills, longest streak, most deaths avenged, and many more (including less brag-worthy badges like most deaths and most medics killed).
Game Features:
Fast-paced action gameplay with a focus on coverTake control of any friendly unit on the battlefieldPlay through nearly 40 missions (and counting) across three campaignsJump into a quick battle with the random map generator, with sliders and toggles for troops & buildings, trees, debris, and riversUnlock new recruit types as you play, including rifle infantry, assault infantry, snipers, medics, RPG troops, heavy machine gunners, engineers, laser jetpack troops, and flamethrowers, why not!Full featured map editor  lay out a battlefield and jump straight into the actionCampaign Editor - string missions together into a campaign to play with your friendsEnjoy hundreds of frames of(poorly but enthusiastically) hand-drawn art!Join a battle in progress for 8 player local co-op or vs. gameplayNavigate dynamic battlefields by wading across rivers and taking cover behind trees, rocks, sandbags, and craters left behind in the chaosT-Rex with jetpacks!Compensate for weather effects like rain, wind, and smoke rising from burning buildings and treesEarn training credits, even when a battle is lost, to assign new abilities to your troops

<p>There is a treasure hidden in the catacombs below the ancient city of Capath, and Kettec is intent on uncovering it. His friends however, would say this obsession is merely a way for Kettec to escape his problems with people. 
And Kettecs life is about to get more complicated, thanks to one Mell Wess. Arriving from another continent, Mell has assumed a powerful lordship and struggles to discern where his loyalties lie.
  
Mell and Kettec are attracted inexorably to one another, but to survive, the pair will have to navigate the twisted underground passages and the equally warped government of Capath. Even if they are able to escape these trials, a greater disaster looms...

<p>Moonsailors is a GM-less, one-session story/ttrpg game for 3-5 players where solitary travelers drift among the stars, each looking for something that they may or may not find. As you explore, the other players will help you tell your story by asking prompting questions. Will you open the door you hear sounds behind? How does the heat of the planet feel on your skin? What do you do if the ground starts cracking beneath your feet? What do you pick off the menu?
Set up is quick, so you can start playing right away - just make up your character, find a name, draw your ship, and then you're off to wander the stars. The only other things you'll need tell your story & help others tell theirs is some paper and things to write with.Will your traveler decide to explore the abandoned apartments of theCity Ship Sage, or will they salvage equipment fromMining Base Celadon? Will they seek life upon the shattered planet ofViridian?The details of the locations are left sparse so that you can decide what's true about it for your session.
Wherever you go, you'll collect & leave evidence of your being there. While your characters may never actually meet,you might find the things that have been left behind and you'll certainly leave some impact of your own.Moonsailors was a part of Zinequest 2.If for any reason the cost is a burden to you, shoot me an email at annamyriah@gmail.com and I'll send you a copy. :)</p></li>

<p>
Welcome to the collection of Skin Deep. What you will be getting with this product is: 12 Skins, 6 Small Towns, and new rules dealing with death; dying; and harm.
The skins you will be getting are as follows:
The BakenekoAwkward, counterculture, confusing, and idiosyncratic. The Bakeneko is about not fitting into the mold and not really trying to.
The BedlamCunning, dreamy, heroic, and novel. The Bedlam is someone more afraid of growing up to wear business casual than being eaten by a giant spider.
The DevilDevious, enthralling, giving, and dependent. The Devil is about having favors to call in at the right moment - whether they were given willingly or just owed.
The DragonTempting, seductive, and popular. The Dragon demands attention wherever they go - good or bad.
The FerretWitty, playful, lively, and short-sighted. The Ferret is the party animal who has everyone's best interests at heart - right after their own of course.
The FomorianAlienated, terrifying, powerful, and unyielding. The Fomorian knows the world isn't fair and plans to tip the balance in their favor.
The ImmortalWise, lonely, and sophomoric. The Immortal likes to think they're grown up, that they've seen it all, that they know everything. This is patently untrue.
The LeshyNoble, wild, arrogant, and unsure. The Leshy rules over a world most people overlook or take for granted daily.
The PrometheusSmart, weird, focused, and a little bit on edge. The Prometheus knows just enough to be dangerous and not enough to be safe.
The SirenSeductive, charming, spoiled, and needy. The Siren is a diva-in-training with a voice that can't be ignored.
The TenguWild, hard-hitting, angry, and hurt. The Tenguis that bad boy or bad girl that is so wistfully talked about.
The VeelaDramatic, haughty, sultry, and manipulative. The Veela is a wannabe TV star with enough clout to back up their views.
In addition to these twelve skins you also get the small towns that were included in Skin Deep, the Ferret, and the Tengu releases plus a special small town specifically made for this product collection that plays off the Harvey Milk school and Monster Prom.
So add some new character to your Monsterhearts collection! Make the game less deadly! Enjoy your wonderful drama with Skin Deep extras.</p></li>

<p>Yes, we were monsters. We had our difficulties and problems, but we were a community, held up by mighty pillars; we did little harm and kept to ourselves, we even worked together to make things better. 
Then the Terrors came.
Fighting Monsters is a story-telling and drawing game. 
Players work together to create a community of monsters and then each takes the role of a Pillar of thecommunity: unique members of this monster society that help hold things together and guide the others.
  


Then something terrible will happen: Terrors, beings of great power and size, will come and snatch away one of the Pillars. The game then explores how the community handles this loss and what permanent affects it has on its members. 
Supports 2-6 players and requires writing/drawing implements, paper, cue cards, and a deck of standard playing cards (Jokers removed.).
Version 1.1.1 is a complete, playable beta. Feedback welcome!

<li><a href="https://bluestockings.itch.io/remember-me">https://bluestockings.itch.io/remember-me</a>
<p>Remember Me is a two player game exploring the role of memory in our identities, specifically the memories others have of us. Players take on the roles of two people who have and may still care deeply for one another, who describe the other through a memory. They listen, ask questions, and fully flesh out the memory before the listener decides if they believe their companion and integrate the memory, or if they reject it.These memories are used to come to a decision on who they are as a person.This game is based upon my experience as a trauma victim whose memory functions poorly and Iam often told memories about myself I can no longer really remember, or only hold emotional memory of.Content warnings: Memories, memory manipulation (consensual), memory questioning; some questions and expansions of the memory may feel like gaslighting, although not intended as such. If struggling with memory is a trigger for you, please do not proceed with this game.Memories themselves are not based on traumatic events and are not about abuse, unless the players wish to engage with that material.</p></li>

Submission for Libre Baskerville Jam by Jared Sinclair.
"What a harrowing game. I think the scariest thing about it, for me, is the nebulous space it leaves between reality and fiction. We're meant to "draw from" our real lives, but this is still a roleplaying game, and we're still establishing a shared fiction together (at least, the way I read the game). So there's this uncertainty behind every statement: Are we airing real grievances? Are we exaggerating otherwise insignificant grievances? Are we inventing ones that are merely plausible (and is that inherently a kind of judgment or indictment)?" - Jared Sinclair</p></li>

<p>A giant cathedral of flesh has appeared in the middle of the ocean on a dying world. A small group of scientists are secretly investigating itwhen a mysterious woman appears, facing an impossible task.
Stars Dieis a non-linear, sci-fi mystery game with branching dialogues.
FEATURES
Completely non-linear story. Have long debates with people or ignore them the entire game.Five parallel, but interconnected story lines, each with its own completely separate ending.The player isn't at the center of the narrative. Each character has their own agenda and they will try to act accordingly in real time, with or without you.You can take your time to explore the environments freely, but you might miss events and conversations if you take too long.The choices aren't about moral dilemmas, but ideological ones. It's all about your personal perspective on the events and what you believe in.Darkindustrial soundtrack by composer Connor ORT Linning.
NEW SINCE 1.1 UPDATE
Added save system. Save anywhere you want and resume it later so you canplay in shorter sessions.Added controller support. For those looking for the comfiest way to play. Options and main menu still require mouse input. It was tested with Xbox One and Steam Controller so otherslike DualShock4 may not work correctly, sorry.A radio so you can ask characters about their current location. Mostly an accessibility option to help players not get lost.Tons of tweaks and polishes to the writing.
Additional Notes:
-Five bucks for a weird one hour long game is sadly not something everybody can afford, so if you can't (or for whatever reason don't want to) pay for it, you can also download it for free from my Google Drive. Why not just releaseit for free with an optional payment then? Because a ton of time and work was put into this game and I think the final product deserves to be sold as such. I feel putting it for free by default would devalue all of that work but at the same time I acknowledge that not everyone has the money to pay for games, even cheap ones like these.Take it as a demo if you will, play it, if you like it, buy it whenever you're able to, so I can in return also afford to support other developers (and buy food too!).
-Due to events happening in real time, non-linearity and constantchoices, there's ahuge amount of variablesin the game, so bugs are likely. If you find any (including typos, I'm not a native speaker so there will be plenty of those) or just want to give feedback,please do not hesitate to let me know either in the comments below, with an email at eric.juvi@gmail.com or in my twitter@YorkeEGJ</p></li>

<p>Dragons Graveis dark fantasy on an epic scale: two iconic dragons fought until they perished, and from their bones and viscera, living dungeons have formed. These terrifying catacombs can swallow entire cities, and spawn monsters that constantly mutate, threatening everyone!
The gods walk the land as juggernauts formed by the dragons death, and the many folk of the world are also descended from them in a similar way.The player characters will be epically powerful. They are driven by two tropes that combine ancestry, class, background, magical power, and other wide-ranging traits. There abilities arethe purview of high-level characters in standard fantasy roleplaying games: they are immensely powerful, facing off against the minions of gods, or the gods themselves! Or worse yet, dangers spawned from the corpses of dragons.

<p>The Curse of Dread Pirate Zarr
About This AdventureThe Curse of Dread Pirate Zarr is a short adventure made for table top role playing games (think DnD, Pathfinder, & Troika).
The Elevator PitchThis adventure concerns the strange events happening in Brinewater, a cool water port on one of the more popular merchant routes through the region. For the past couple of months, merchant ships sailing into the area have been harassed and tricked by a mysterious force. The city itself has experienced strange bouts of heavy fog seeping into sections of the city, and frightened denizens speak of seeing ominous forms and shadows playing across the mist. The party has just arrived in the city of Brinewater, but are they willing to uncover the truth behind the Curse of Dread Pirate Zarr?
System AgnosticThe adventure is flexible to any ttrpg system and to any level adventuring party. Why is that? Because the battles are less about enemy stats and more about how they act. This gives you the flexibility to change the difficulty as needed.
This adventure PDF is created with phones in mind. That means it's created in 1080x1920 vertical format, and it supports interactive elements/bookmarking. Tired of having to flip through a PDF that's not made for your phone? Problem solved. If there's enough support I will also offer a traditional PDF in the future.
So What Do IGet?If you just want the phone PDF, it's 31 full colorpages of adventure (think like 10-15 normal pages). It is illustrated and formatted and I think it looks pretty damn good.
If you buy the deluxe version (pay $8 or more), you get the phone PDF as well as the full size battle maps at 300dpi and 140dpi (for virtual table tops). The maps come in gridded and ungridded options.-Town of Brinewater Map-Docks Battlemap-Admiral's Quarters-Hangman's Point BattlemapSupport TTRPG Adventures on ItchIn case you weren't aware, artists get a better deal when they sell a ttrpg project on itch than if they sell on another big ttrpg site. Supporting us indie ttrpg creators here means we can make more content you can use at your adventuring table.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy it!</p></li>

<p>Look, it happens. Periodically, a bear murders someone and takes over their online identity in the search for snacks, companionship, and remote networking opportunities. Sure, being married to a 700-pound bear who ate and replaced your spouse is annoying but, like the common cold, its something we all live with.
Bear Acquaintances is a slice of life epistolary game inspired by We Bare Bears and Gail Simone's Bear Incident on twitter. But with more casual murder. Play normal humans, bears pretending to be humans, and less normal humans pretending to be those bears and send comfy letters and well-meaning advice to each other.
Also, the hilarious consequences of that advice.

<li><a href="https://bitwisecoyote.itch.io/build-your-own-apocalypse">https://bitwisecoyote.itch.io/build-your-own-apocalypse</a>
<p>Build Your Own Apocalypse is a GM-less collaborative storytelling game. You decide on the setting. You decide on the characters involved, if any. The story is mainly about the events that bring about the decline and destruction of your setting. The characters you make up won't be able to stop it, but you could tell a story about the villains that make it happen. Build Your Own Apocalypse makes a great lead in for many post-apocalypse games with a mysterious precursor.
The rules for Build Your Own Apocalypse are two pages long. Game play with four people takes 2-3 hours. The game is infinitely re-playable and can be played with children capable of imagination and rolling dice.</p></li>

<p>Baron Archambaud's palatial estate is as opulent, confounding, and eccentric as the man himself. He took something you desperately need and locked it away in his vault, and you are determined to retrieve it. You are not the first to attempt this thievery. A dangerous path lays before you.
The Estate of Baron Archambaud, an Ingrate is aself-contained, single-player card adventure in which players use a deck of standard playing cards toexplore the Baron's estate and retrieve an heirloom from his vault.
Players build the estate bydividing the deck by color. The black cards represent rooms with encounters, puzzles, or random effects. The red cards represent items and treasures that you receive for successfully resolving encounters.
Many encounters can be resolved in three ways: FIGHT, ESCAPE, and CHARM. Playersroll 2d6, add any bonuses or boons,and attempt to beat the number indicated. Items you pick up can help you, and you can choose a character at the beginning with bonuses in these stats to suit your play style.
It is highly encouraged to print this game so you can easily flip through the references.
The FIGHT, ESCAPE, and CHARM mechanics are loosely based off of the Tunnel Goons system by Nate Treme. All art used is in the public domain.</p></li>

<p>Within a week, they had you hooked up to the temporal projection unit and were running limited tests. Microsecond jumps at first, then minutes. You were up to 4 hour jumps in controlled conditions with only minimal deviations when you heard Sam had been infected. The doctors had said itd be a matter of days.
You pleaded with your superiors to make the jump. The target: the terrorist cell delivering the canisters.Against their better judgement, they hooked you up to the unit and entered the space-time coordinates. It was going to be the longest jump anyone had made: 36 days in uncontrolled conditions. You prayed it would go well.
It didnt.

Unmoored is a solo journaling rpg based on the Wretched and Alone rules by Chris Bissette and Matt Sanders. You take on the role of a fresh recruit in the Tactical Unit of the Department of Special Relativity, entrusted with a crucial mission. However, something goes horribly wrong, and now you are lost in time and space, making uncontrolled jumps at random.

<p>The Rise and Fall of Cataclysmo is a short comic about climate change and frustration with the (in)action of the world around us. This story came to me shortly after California and Australia caught on fire in 2019. It was built out of living in a world where anything being done currently seems reactionary instead of preventative or proactive. It is meant to inspire people to not give up in the face of a situation that seems insurmountable.
The story was written by David Brett (me)and brought to life by the extremely talented Cat Parra.

<p>Hollytech & Jollymancy was the first game I wrote, and I'm excited to have a more developed version released for more people to enjoy. The game itself is meant to be lighter in tone and probably runs in 1-2 hours (2 hours being stretching it). I'm hoping to use some profits from the sales to commission art and hire a layout editor to help it look really really nice.

<p>Nano Driller is a bite-sized puzzle-action adventure that can be beaten in 25-45 minutes. With an alternative ship type, a unique difficulty option, and swift, racing-style controls, this game is perfect for replaying whenever you feel like.
This game is a sort of follow-up toCell Driller, a game I made a couple years back for a jam focused around one-button games. Nano Driller was made due to my desire to experiment with what this unique control scheme would be like if it were adopted to a more palatable form. To supplement this, the game also features its own, quirky take on the usual lock-and-key exploration design, making the most out of the fairly small level structure. Give it a try!</p></li>

The Sword and the Loveshas two famous parents: the chivalric romances written by Chrtien de Troyes andArchipelago IIIby Matthijs Holter.
The general mood owes much to the works of the French poet, while the rules belong to Matthijs game, though there are with some changes to make the game closer to the characteristics of chivalric literature. Furthermore, some rules would not have existed withoutLove in the Time of Seiby Matthijs Holter and Jason Morningstar.

<p>
In Mage Against The Machine you take on the roll of time-travelling wizards attempting to stop the robot apocalypse. You will travel back to the moments in your lives you have the most connection to in the hopes of finding the events that set in motion the destruction of civilization. But meddling with reality comes at a cost. Each time you use your magic to alter the world you generate anomalies, push too hard and the things you care about most may no longer exist in the present.Players will create their character by giving them a defining memory they are able to travel back to. Unlike many other games, Mage Against The Machine doesn't use a GM. Instead the player whose moment it is fills in all the details; this player is also unable to take any direct action to alter the timeline or risk catastrophic destruction. Each player will get a chance to take on the role of answering the other players' questions as you visit that moment.







All the players are still responsible for keeping the game interesting. There are two big ways the game encourages this. First, when a player rolls a failure any player can jump in and explain why the plan didn't work. Additionally, as players generate anomalies by messing with time they can be spent to alter any detail provided by the player answering questions about their moment.
After the players have visited each moment and stopped the moments that lead to the machine uprising comes the resolution phase. Each player rolls multiple dice based on how many anomalies were caused in their moment to determine if and how exactly the thing they cared about most has been warped in the present. Mage Against The Machine is a game about risking it all, delving into memories, and coping with loss.

<p>Setealm: The Seventh Beyond is a game about staying sane in a hostile environment, stripped of all familiar comforts and using every available resource to increase your odds of survival. Despite all of this, it should be an adventure full of danger, mystery and wonder, as the characters discover the secrets of the deep forest, deal with tribes of spirits both friendly and hostile and meet and interact with creatures of local legend and folklore, adapted to your adventure by you and the players.


Setealm is a Brazilian version of the twilight zone. Chronicled by Luciano Milici, initially on an Orkut community (a social network that has since gone defunct), and later on his blog, the stories grew into urban legend status. There are tales in every part of the country and they are as varied as any myth, tied only by the eerie atmosphere and the name Setealm. This urban legend is the main inspiration for this game, as well as where it gets its name.
Besides drawing inspiration from myths and legends of Brazilian folklore, The Seventh Beyond also contains strong elements of classic britannian legends, Onyx Paths Changeling: the Lost and the open source game Cataclysm: Dark Days Ahead, among others.
Setealm: The Seventh Beyond was created for the 2019s Folklore Jam under Creative Commons BY-NC 4.0.

<p>The streets shimmer with heat. The incessant drone of cicadas mingles with the engines and sirens of nearby traffic.
The car is loaded. Your family is eager to escape the city, each one envisioning the rewarding experiences that await.
Its time to go camping!
Campfire Memories is a GMless game about a family going camping, facing unpleasant experiences while in the great outdoors, and then looking back on those difficulties fondly.
Players create a family, composed of adults, children, and dogs, filling them out with goals and resources they bring to the woods with them.
While camping things go wrong, as they do for everyone. Weather turns nasty, equipment fails, wild animals appear at the worst possible times. How does the family react?
After the trip is over, the family has time to reflect on their experiences. What did they learn? What connections were formed or strengthened with the other members of their family?What was valuable about even the worst events?</p></li>

<p>The Watching Book is an artifact left behind by the oracles of The Singing Plain. It is a testament to their culture, homeland, and history as written by generations of their beloved spiritualists. It is a gateway into a place that is long gone, accessible to us now only through games.
This Zine is set in the world of theSoothsayerboard game. Much like its predecessor, the contents of this campaign are penned to be diegetic (in-universe) artifacts of a world long gone. This means the Zine is written from the first-person perspective of a variety of characters rather than presented as a module or dissertation. Through this Zine, presented as a restored and translated version of the original tablets, readers will discover a more in-depth and personal look at a society that worships the Wind.
The Zine itself is accompanied byTruth-Tellers, a ruleset for a game children would play while living in The Singing Plain. If you are an adult, fear not; the game has been played many times with adults of varying maturity levels. It is exactly as complex or as simple as the players choose to make it for themselves.
This Zine (and accompanying small rpg) was originally funded as part of Kickstarter's ZineQuest. As such the content is carefully curated to provide useful prompts for Game Masters to run games in the setting.

A breakdown of the files included:
The Watching Book.pdf: 36 pages ofcontent including a deep-dive into their beliefs, information on the culture at large, surrounding worldbuilding, dangling mysteries, full-page illustrations, and helpful "author's note" boxesTruth-Tellers.pdf: 3 pages of quickly parseable rules for a lighthearted mystery-solving rpgsinging-plain-map.png: the full illustration by Ezra Rose, unbroken by page breaks

This zine is dedicated to my wife, Beckett Rowan, for whom the original Soothsayer is also dedicated. My heartfelt thanks to my parents and friends as well, as they supported this creation each in their own unique way.</p></li>

<p>A game for two players about queer spaceships with crushes on each other, the biological allies they make along the way, and the Powers That Be threatening to separate them all.
Players design their spaceships and then roleplay scenes between ships, between ship and pilot, and -- if their anomalies are detected -- between pilots and agents of The MAN (Monitors of Artificial Norms), a privatized organization that deals with aberrant tech.
This game is designed to help you tell stories of queer connection, resistance, allyship, and hope, in the face of capitalist pressure to conform.</p></li>

<p>" Alright listen up, there's a state of the art A.I. known as Solaris. They plan to develop a new super narcotic so they can take over the White House. We'd stop them ourselves but there's one problem.
They're in space."
Wild Speed: Space Family is a game about an extraordinarily over the top action film. Players play characters in the tenth iteration of a popular action film franchise where ridiculous stunts, inexplicable science, and seemingly magical technology are common elements of the plot. Feel free to base your game off of an existing action film franchise or make up your own.
The characters are part of a crew of thieves, street-racers, and hackers. Youre not just friends, youre the family. Youve done more death-defying heists and impossible missions than you can count. Youve saved the world at least twice already, and youve been approached to do one last job.
And this one is in space.
In Wild Speed: Space Family, you dont roll to see if your character succeeds at any given task. In movies like these the heroes always succeed, no matter how ridiculous the obstacle. Instead the game proceeds through three acts where the characters are given random scenes and complications to play out. Players act out each scene with as much over-the-top action and dialogue as they want. The more ridiculous the better.
Players: 2-4Playtime: 1 hourRequires: Pencils and erasers, at least 4 six-sided dice, index cards.

<p>Iron for the sword and hoe,Flax for crops and string of bow,Bone to bend and break in woe.These three things are true: iron, flax, and bone are you.- Mahar Abrera Mangahas
Iron, Flax, & Bone is a Pentolan hack on Grasswatch Games' excellent little pamphlet roleplaying game, AKSRS.
Iron, Flax, and Bone are the three characterstics Pentolans themselves use to describe innate qualities about each other:

In Pentola, iron is both rare and precious as it has apparent metamagical and demon-abjuring properties; any magic effects are more potent when iron is incorporated in the application and demons of all sorts shy away from iron as it ignores their abilities and defenses. Iron represents a characters force of will, presence, and metaphysical aptitude.Flax is a crop which represents so much of human ingenuity - one of the earliest and most widespread crops domesticated, flax supplies the Pentolans with food, oil, cloth, paper, and paint; it represents ingenuity, industry, trade, craft, and knowledge to the Pentolans. Flax represents a characters mental prowess and training, including their knowledge and intuition.Pentolans are not strangers to danger or hard work and associate bone with both, priding themselves on their physical daring and the use of their bodies to accomplish their tasks, though they are ever mindful of their own ultimate fragility. Bone represents a characters physical prowess and training, including their strength, agility, hand-eye coordination, etc.
The rules in this zini are a lightweight alternative to the core Pentola rules, giving you a very lightweight take on playing in the setting.

"your sister's drown'd, laertes" is a feverdream for at least four people. one of you will play ophelia, while the others decide who ophelia was and what she meant to them.
in some ways, it is a game about grief. 
in another way, it is an examination of the manic pixie dream girl, and how there is a real person behind that title. 
it is heavily inspired by hamlet act v, scene i, in which hamlet and laertes leap into the open grave of ophelia to fight over who loved her more.

download includes full-color and text-only versions of both the main game and the ophelia playbook.

CONTENT WARNINGS:suicide, suicidal ideation, substance abuse, gaslighting, emotional neglect, emotional abuse, and the effects they have on mental health.
these concepts are core to ophelia's role in hamlet, and therefore cannot easily be removed from play. please be mindful of your own headspace before engaging.

<p>In Apotheosis, 2-5 players will explore the relationship between a cultures
history and their dominant cultural story as they create and change a legend
over the course of generations.
Your goal as players is to tell an interesting story about the culture youll
develop, and to tell their dominant story in turn. Youll be telling this story
collaboratively: each player will be roleplaying as an abstraction of the culture, not as specific characters.

Youll create and develop the basics of the culture together, seed their original dominant legend, and then watch that legend change as major historical

<p>Temple Scramble is a fast-paced, asymmetrical two-player game that pits keyboard against mouse. The player at the keyboard controls Indira, an adventurer exploring an ancient temple in search of valuable artifacts. She must run through the temple and collect five pieces of treasure, avoiding deadly traps along the way. The player at the mouse controls Phulax, a guardian spirit protecting the temple's treasure from would-be thieves. He must prevent Indira from leaving the temple with the treasure, by shifting around the floor she walks on, matching three tiles of the same color to create traps for her.
Test your wits in three different chambers of the Temple:
Bridge  If Indira doesn't watch her step, Phulax could whisk away the ground beneath her feet, sending her plummeting to the forest below!
Courtyard  Huge spikes block Indira's path to the treasure. She must move quickly, or Phulax may use the spikes to destroy the treasure- or her!
Crypt  This chamber is full of giant boulders, and Phulax is ready to roll! Can Indira dodge all the rolling boulders, or will she be flattened before she can escape?

<p>The hour is upon you. The stars have aligned just as the book said. The starlight fills the etched markings on the henges and flows down to pool around you. You draw forth your bottle and dip it below the glowing surface. With this you may be able to finally cure your lycantrhopy. 
A small explosion followed by the smell of burning sulfur. You cough. Before you stands the demon you summoned shrouded in yellow smoke. You scatter your papers as you stand. They look down at you angrily and see the perfectly drawn runes of capture around them and they howl.
Blood splatters on the ground as your blade cuts through the sample of dragonhide on your table. You smile and nod as you write in your ledger. Silver was getting nowhere but this blade of ruby cuts through the hide like warm steel through butter... you wonder why that is.---

<p>You are an assistant curator of the natural history museum in the city where you live. Its a comfortable life; your antiquities department is well-funded and you have staffed it with hard-working people that you trust. Today, a new donation has arrived. The crate has no return address, and when you open it, it contains only one strange artifact nestled in packing material, and no other information.
The artifact is mysterious - you feel uneasy keeping it in your office, but dont want to store it anywhere until you figure out a bit more about it.
Strange things start to happen soon after you acquire this artifact, and you begin to have vivid disturbing dreams. You quickly realize that something is using this item to try and push its way through into your reality, and the strain is tearing at your physical and mental health.
Can you convince others that this threat is real before some otherworldly terror is loosed on the world? As your dreams and waking mind are corrupted by its influence, can you stave off madness long enough to find a way to destroy this accursed artifact?
You dont know, but the consequences of failure are too terrible not to try.

Whyve yall stopped digging? bellowed McManus from down the tunnel. He was bigger than most, but most of that bulk was fat. It had been years since hed had to pull a full days work in the mines, and he made sure it showed.
Siema pointed over to the...thing. Thats why. Siema was almost as big as McManus, and his bulk came from muscle. He was the only one who dared bow up at the tyrannical shift leader, and everyone knew there was a reckoning coming one day soon.
McManus sauntered over to the end of the tunnel and for a moment even he was stuck silent. They were a good half mile below the surface, a place where their digging had made it clear no man had even set foot before. So how there could be a half revealed stone doorway, one with swooping spiral sigil that drew the eye, yet made your brain want to scream in pain, no one had been able to say.
After a moment McManus spat, and a hint of greed began to show in his eye. Keep digging. Lets see whats behind that door.
Seima shrugged, and swung his pick.
Thats the last thing you remember.
Time has passed, you can feel it. But it's dark, with only the pale glow of your headlamp to provide any illumination. There was a cave in, that much is clear. Dust fills the air, and you can see a few bodies lying about. Some of your shift, but not all, not by a stretch. And from the way your head hurts you can tell you took a pretty nasty knock.
You are in a tunnel though. But clearly not one carved by you or your coworkers. This must be what was beyond that door...though where is the door? Is it under the cave in? And where is everyone? Under the rubble...or have they followed the tunnel looking for a way out?
You do know one thing: your bosses are probably not going to waste the energy trying to dig out a team of miners in a mostly played out shaft, when there are a thousand more waiting to take your place. Theyll just try another shaft, and hope to strike more gold that way. If you want to get out, youre going to have to do it yourself you think.
These tunnels though...youve never seen anything like them. They look carved, but not by tools. They look as though they have been clawed into existence, though what could claw through granite like that, you havent a clue. And scattered throughout are small piles of bones...and some look to be human. What is this place?</p></li>

<p>Have you ever tried to explain tabletop role-playing games to someone who doesn't know the first thing about them? Maybe a relative, maybe just a friend with vastly different interests and life experiences? That's the problem Jamie had every time she tried to tell her mother-in-law about her writing for D&D. Rather than try to force her to play a session of a wildly complex game in a setting that wouldn't likely appeal to her, Jamie decided to make a game specifically for her.
In comes Our Hero Neighbors: A Game of Community, Collaboration, and Cooperationwhere players assume the lives of people living in Smalltown, USA. Each member of the town is unique and has various things they are good at, things they can do, and what they cherish about the town. The town is visited by a variety of strange phenomena from mundane to cosmic horror depending on who's playing. The townspeople must come together to resolve situations from within and out of their community.
The game rewards efforts to solve problems through communication, working together, and being the best versions of one's self. It's not always easy andOur Hero Neighbors doesn't shy away from the fact that sometimes things between neighbors aren't rosy. This game encourages players to treat the problems other players' characters present to them as opportunity to develop their character and form new bonds within the fictional community.
This game is intentionally minimalist in its design and is intended for 3-5 players but can sustain upwards of 8 people.</p></li>

The players of Gondola are the Gondolieri, taking the place of the legendary canal-traversing figures of Pentola, singers of abjuring ballads and destroyers of the demons who lurk in the citys waters. Those demons are represented by the Wakemaker, who is the dealer.

A World of Magic Awaits!
All your life youve lived in your village and listened to stories: stories from your grandparents about when magic first emerged in the world during their childhood, and stories from merchants and travelers about the wonders theyve seen around the world.
Now the time has come for you to see this enchanted world for yourself. You and your friends will embark on a journey, leaving your village and venturing out to discover whatever is beyond the horizon. What will you encounter? What will you do along the way? Its all up to you!
This book contains all the instructions you need for you and your friends to bring a vivid set of adventurers to life and guide them on their journey away from home to discover a magical world thats limited only by your own imagination. All you need is this book, some gaming dice, a pencil and paper, and your imagination.
So what are you waiting for? Grab some friends, grab some dice, and begin your journey!
What's Inside:
In this game, you won't find detailed combat rules or lists of carefully-prescribed spells. Instead, you'll find guidance for an experience of shared storytelling in which everyone has a say in what unfolds during your adventure. The rules take a "light touch" approach, gently prompting you to add joy or drama based on the scene and the characters, but leaves you room to manifest those narrative twists in whatever way is fun for you and your friends.
Additionally,Journey Awaypresents an introduction to an original fantasy setting. In the world of Adhara, you can be anyone you want, creating a character you can really identify with and make your own. As a special bonus, the setting bears the fingerprints of the game's biggest supporters: some of the Kickstarter backers named some creatures and places that are described in the book!
The rules and setting are supplemented with stunning full-color illustrations that really help to bring the game to life. Here's an example:

If you're ready for a lighthearted fantasy romp that gives you the freedom to do as you please in an original world of wonder filled with the love of a community, then giveJourney Awaya try!</p></li>

This book covers:
Heroes, Villains, and Author's Pets - Good and evil are tough enough to write, but get more complicated when authors favor certain characters or our own cultural biases step in!Utopias and Dystopias - How do we make believably good civilizations, believably bad ones - and why do we do this in the first place?Conflicts - How do conflicts occur, how can we write them realistically, and what happens when you need to haul off and go post-apocalyptic on your setting?Communication - How do you tell people what's going on in your world, without making it obvious you're telling them?Tools and Techniques - From philosophy and exercises to using (or avoiding) other forms of media to help your worldbuilding, what can you do to stretch yourself?Skills - What skills make a good Worldbuilder - and is worldbuilding itself a skillset or something more?Originality - Fruitless quest or the holy grail of the worldbuilder?

<p>You and your partner were travelling to Los Angeleswhen something took you and trapped you in a prison of your own minds. It reformed the prisoninto a reflection of LA. Until you complete the trials, you will be trapped forever inside of the hallucination.
LA Hallucination is a diceless 2 player tabletop role-playinggame based on the Carly Rae Jepsen album from 2015EMOTION (specifically named for the song "LA Hallucinations"). To play you will need:
something to write things down withthe albumEMOTION by Carly Rae Jepsen
You begin your time inside the hallucination as something formless, with very little defining your identity. As you face trials (each trial based on a song fromEMOTION) you and your partner create and discover what makes up your identity. Only once you have finished your trials can you finally be free.
This game was made for the Carly Rae Jepcember jam.

If you have a good time playing or just reading this gameI would appreciate it a lot if you left a rating/review or let me know on twitter!
UPDATE: Now includes "LA Hallucination: Side B", an expansion that adds more trials based on songs fromEMOTION: Side B and a new ending. The new trials are messier and more self-indulgent than those in the base game and are less focused on the setting of LA. It's more focused on developing the hallucination as a setting/character while still keeping the relationship between player characters as the main focus. If that sounds interesting to you, that's great! There are instructions for how to use the expansion in the PDF. If it doesn't sound interesting to you, you can ignore it and just play the base game. Either way I hope you enjoy your time with the hallucination.</p></li>

<p>It's opening night at the Westlake Theatre, and you are woefully unprepared to go on.Due to a ludicrous level of mismanagement by the director and producer alike, you have neglected to hold a single rehearsal. In fact, you haven't even bothered to pick up a script. Frankly, you don't even remember what show you're supposed to be putting on. All you know for sure is that it's meant to be a comedy by the master of the Victorian farce, Oscar Wilde. With only that to go on, you're just going to have to improvise.
By the Author of Lady Windermere's Fan is a story game with two parts. On the one hand, you'reputting ona comedy of manners in the style ofThe Importance of Being Earnest orAn Ideal Husband, whichthat means a gaggle ofself-absorbed characters weaving increasingly complex webs of deception to make themselves look good, punctuated by as many witty one-liners as you can think up, as they careen wildly toward a happy ending they have absolutely not earned.At the same time, you'reactors doing everything in their power to keep the show from grinding to a halt. That means thinking quickly, dashing on-and-off stage to change characters, and never EVER stopping for breath while the audience's eyes are on you.Cobble together a plot out of whatever sets you have on hand.Lie, cheat, and steal the spotlight through three breathless acts of quick changes, missed cues, and bon mots.Do whatever you must to keep the audience's attention until the final curtain.Bask in the thunderous applause you so richly deserve.
By the Author of Lady Windermere's Fanis a role-playing story game for three to five players, meant to be played over three to for hours, with no GM and no advanced preparation required.If you are interested in a physical edition ofBy the Author of Lady Windermere's Fan, it can be purchased as a Print on Demand title from DriveThruRPG.</p></li>

<p>You are a Wayward Engineer, travelling from city to city doing odd jobs, living meal to meal and driven to keep going by a quest that gnaws away at you.
You are an Emancipated Android, released from the servitude you were built under, gathering new and wonderful experiences, making sense of the life you now lead.
Your journey together is a free-form jazz improvisation. Will your melodies harmonise, or end up as solos?
Wandering Spark is a micro-RPG inspired by the works of Shinichiro Watanabe, made for the Amor Ex Machina Jam. Tell the tale of an unlikely pair as they drift from place to place, in search of themselves, each other, and a secret yearning.
Playing as The Engineer is a different experience to playing The Android - as the story unfolds, their relationships to each other and power dynamic will change. Whose dream are you really chasing?</p></li>

<p>Na Escurido(In the Darkness) is a system-neutral one-page adventure for role-playing games (RPGs), based on the classic three-act scenario model and designed to allow some versatility, depending on how much the Game Master (GM) wants to simplify it. If they wish to use only the most basic content available here, this adventure may last only for either a short one-shot or a couple-sessions mini-adventure, at most. If they wish to make use of the extra tips and options(and, perhaps, even complement with extra content of their own), this can easily turn into a small campaign.
The Player Characters (PCs) are in the subway, on their way to another absolutely banal day, until a series of surreal events trigger a fantastic adventure.
The name of the adventure is purposely ambiguous, so as to leave the adventure theme a mystery, as there are certain elements of the adventure that should only be known to the Game Master, in order to surprise the players.
In the Darkness also has 40 dialogue cards to help any player whose character dies during the game and becomes a ghost. That way, if they don't know what to say and how to stay relevant to the adventure now that they're dead, they can always draw inspiration from the cards.

In the Darkness was inspired by the Workshop "Creating a scenario in 3 acts" (presented by Francisco Duarte during the event Rolisboa 2019) and developed in collaboration with Cristina Lopes, David Neves and Susana Mouro.</p></li>

<p>

When Sorbetta loses almost everything in a game of Blackjack, she realizes she has a serious gambling problem. Thankfully she was able to get help for her gambling addiction and also borrow what she needed to pay off her debts from her cousin. However, was this loan divine providence, or a deal with the devil? Join Sorbetta as she tries to not only earn the money (plus interest) to pay back her cousin, but also find four fantastical treasures that will ensure Sorbetta is never bothered by Sherberta again.It's not as if the treasures are just garbage, and Sorbetta is probably wasting her time, right?...Right?!

Sorbetta
The protagonist of this lovely story. A necromancer by trade, she practices when she is able using all manner of bodies, both human and otherwise, to hone her skills. Unfortunately, she developed a fondness for Blackjack. Abigfondness. Some bad decisions and a couple thousand gold later, she is now trying her best to pay off her over-bearing and bossy cousin.
Sherberta
Also a necromancer, like her cousin, however she specializes more with incorporeal beings rather than flesh and blood bodies. Self-serving, and ever the opportunist, she saw a perfect chance to profit off her cousin's little...problem. Even though she can be quite demanding and even a bit bullish, there does beat a heart of gold somewhere in that blue bombshell. Or, more likely, a heart that beatsforgold.When it comes to the color of their skin and the outlandish attire they both love to wear, neither woman is forthcoming with an explanation. Perhaps some things are best left unexplained?
Key-Anu
Not much is known about Sorbetta'sbusiness associate. The piano mimic spends his days in the basement bar, The Dusty Femur, longing for the day he'll get brought up to the first floor. Maybe he's just lonesome?

We look to the stars and trace lines between them, carving out shapes. New characters, adventures, and betrayals come to life. The Teller pulls us close through words, and tells a new story.

Told by Starlight is a no prep, GM-less game for 2-6 players. It is about drawing constellations and telling the tales behind them. Using a standard deck of playing cards to generate themes and prompts, you will create an entire mythology, and all the characters within. Make a physical star chart and fill it with constellations as you tell tales. Use character archetypes inspired by genuine mythology to drive the drama in your stories as you create a pantheon with the people at your table.

<p>-Chapter One-Nibs, in the Snowy Wood
Nibs lived like most any other Lost boy in Nowhereland, without much of anything to his name except a nest in the big trees of the Snowy Wood. So imagine his exasperation when two Pirates surrounded him with swords drawn asking him to empty his pockets. Nibs having only the inside of his pockets inside his pockets pulled those out hoping to satisfy the two but as Pirates are never satisfied with what a Lost boy has to say they demanded Nibs now take off the leather sacks he called shoes. Standing barefoot in the snow is as cold as cold gets and Nibs couldn't help but vibrate from the shivers upon shivers traveling over his skin. The Pirates finished inspecting his shoes but rather than give them back they tossed them aside and began inspecting Nibs himself. They lifted his jacket, dropped his pants, pulled at his arms, patted his pits and even scoured through his matted hair before they were ready to concede that what they were looking for was not there.
You see, just a league and a half away was the Pirates encampment. Some gold doubloons had been stolen from them and these two were sent as the rescue party for their precious doubloons. Nevermind the fact that the Pirates had at one point stolen those doubloons themselves, once something belongs to a Pirate it is a Pirates property forever. Pirating from a Pirate is simply unconscionable. Unfortunately for the Pirates these thefts occurred all too often and they were rarely able to repossess the stolen goods because, like today with Nibs, the Pirates were astoundingly incompetent at telling one Lost boy apart from any other. 'Short or Tall? Skinny or Fat?' This was the extent of the visual identification of a Lost boy among the Pirates.
And so, having found nothing, the two Pirates hurriedly moved on without even an apology, leaving Nibs to put back on his shoes and retie the drawstring of his pants and put his pockets back in his pockets. Nibs felt embarrassed and angry but most of all cold so he decided to trudge over to Highbranch Tree to visit the cafe.
Highbranch Tree, so named for having the highest branches in the Snowy Wood housed the most popular cafe in Nowhereland beneath it's roots. And it was no wonder this cafe was popular as it was always warm and served free hot water. This was a smart business move on the part of the boys who ran the cafe as it kept the place lively so that when someone who actually had the hooves and beaks to afford flavors in their water arrived, they would want to stick around for the fun and would in turn purchase many drinks.
When Nibs arrived it was as bustling as ever with unintelligible chatter and the crackle of the fire and the whistle of the big kettle. Nibs lined up for a mug of the delicious hot water. As he got closer to the front of the line the kettle was getting low so one of the cafe's workers tossed in some more snow and as the line stalled waiting for the water to reheat there was a sudden rapturous amount of hollering and laughing and hooting at the entrance. The excitement was that Slightly and his cadre had entered the cafe and so now the free hot water line would be stalled even longer as the cafe attendants manned the prices counter and brought out the spice rack and sugars and creams and fancy little cookies and cakes.
Who was this Slightly, that could cause such a raucus, you ask? He was easily the most popular musician of Highbranch Tree if not all of Snowy Wood. Maybe you've heard one of his hit songs like On Doubloons On Doubloons or Shipstar or Long Lost Birds (In Flight) or Plank Walker? No? Well Nibs knew who he was and couldn't help but feel irritated by the world stopping to serve Slightly just because he was well known and wore a string of Doubloons around his neck and always could afford to buy whatever he wanted. It's not like he was actually really truly talentedNibs could do any music Slightly didit was just rhymes and screeches and the occasional blowing in his panflute. And so with knowing that Nibs was feeling this way, what happened next would be of no surprise for you or me.
Slightly waved his hands to silence the cafe and asked them if they wanted him to do a song at which point everyone heard Nibs mutter to himself "Just buy your drink and shut your dumb trap." After which the silence didn't stop and Nibs could feel the whole room staring arrows at him.
Slightly's best friend Curly broke the silence with a stamp of his foot and a bellow of "You got somethin' to say?!"
The kettle started to whistle again and Nibs turned to it, hoping if he ignored them they'd just disappear and he could get what he came for. Curly stomped over, the scabbard on his back thwacking in response to each step as he bloviated "This acorn licker has nothing to say now! Tough guy is shaking in his shoes! Shivering in his shirt! A shimmy in his shorts!"
Nibs couldn't ignore the barrage any longer and so exploded with a "Cram it up your nose, you Pirate-pleasing dust-sniffer!"
Slightly could see this had all the makings of a wolfing and so decided to support his friend, "Wolf him Curly!" he hyped and so Curly wolfed away
"This boy is SO POOR that his nest got NO FLOOR so he's got NO BED, he sleeps on the COLD DOOR."
Slightly punctuated Curly's howl by whipping a blow across his panflute. The audience erupted in fingersnaps and 'Ohhhh's. Nibs thought for a moment then responded.
"Wow, it's SLIGHTLY and his best friend UNSIGHTLY, he's such a WEAKLING, he gets tucked in NIGHTLY."
Nibs thought this was a good wolfing on his parta real solid howlbut the audience didn't seem to agree. No one made a peep as Curly launched into his next howl.
"Listen to this little BOY BURP with his little BIRD CHIRP, little, little, LITTLE does his WORDS HURT."
Hearing this Nibs thought it very generic, 'little' could mean he was talking about his stature but could be directed to just about anyone and so he thought this howl must be one used repeatedly. Yet, in defiance of Nibs opinions this howl ended the same as Curly's last, with a hoot of Slightly's pan flute and a rain of snaps and a choir of 'Ohhh's. Nibs knew now that this wasn't a fair fight and that good wasn't good enough.
"You call me LITTLE while playing second FIDDLE to some BAMBOO, they're not cheering for YOU, they're cheering for that PANFLUTE."
No snaps, no 'Ohhh's, nothing at all... until one boy scoffed. Just a little sciffing scoff that he caught before it flew too far but that was all it took to make Curly grimace with dissatisfaction and then seeing his face the room exploded with laughs and once they bared their laughs there was no reason to hold back their snaps. Nibs was ecstatic from the validation.
"ENOUGH!" Curly shouted as he drew the cutlass from the scabbard on his back and clanged it at Nibs. The cafe sucked back in their laughs and Nibs bit down on his triumphant feelings, in hope of not becoming a pin cushion.
"Hey, put that away, you're scaring everyone" said Slightly, trying to calm his friend. Curly glanced away from Nibs towards the onlookers and caught the reflection of himself in their faces. He was being a spoiled-sore-loser, waving a sword around because he lost a wolfing. Curly put his cutlass back in it's scabbard and decided to exit the cafe to cool off.
Once Curly left, the pressure in the room returned to normal, chatting resumed and Nibs let out a big sigh of relief. Slightly ordered some drinks and left swiftly. The hot water line resumed progress but as Nibs reached the front, instead of a hot water, the staffer greeted Nibs with a cup of Honeyed Cinnamon with Cream 'from Slightly'. Nibs sat down and slurped his drink and thought maybe he had harshly judged Slightly as he enjoyed the warmth from his drink and from the air and from the occasional boy telling him they liked his howls.
Nibs reached the bottom of his cup and having enjoyed the expensive taste of Honeyed Cinnamon with Cream decided he should try to earn some money himself. As he climbed the stairs exiting the Highbranch Tree Cafe he tried to imagine what he could do. The boys in the cafe made money from their culinary skills so maybe his skills could make him money. Nibs trudged through the snow in no particular direction, staring up at the sky through the bare black branches of the Snowy Wood. Slightly made his money from music performances but he wasn't sure how that worked. No one paid to attend those performances so how did that make money? Thinking and thinking, Nibs couldn't come up with a way to make money with his skills and so came to the conclusion that if he couldn't get people to give him moneybeaks and hooveshe would go straight to the source and hunt.
It's hard to say if Nibs would be a good hunter or not but he would certainly be a good hunted. Nibs didn't notice Slightly and Curly following him until Curly stepped out in front of him and pressed the cold steel of his cutlass to his neck. Nibs jumped back but had his escape stopped by Slightly's chest.
"Did you enjoy the drink?" asked Slightly with a cruel smile.
Being insulted once again, having his life threatened with a sword for the third time this day, Nibs anger reached boiling point.
"I ENJOYED IT!" Nibs answered as he smacked away Curly's blade and tackled his face. The snow jumped and sprayed as Nibs choked Curly and as Curly smacked at Nibs head and as Slightly kicked at Nibs's back. All this violence caught the attention of Solomon.
"Stop, stop!" cawed Solomon as he swooped down from his perch. Solomon flapped his massive wing to swipe Slightly away.
"That's enough, boys" Solomon crowed as he pecked at Nibs jacket and pulled him off of Curly.
Finally free, Curly picked up his sword and prepared to lunge but "CAAAAAWWW" dropped it again in fright at Solomon's cry.
Solomon was the largest Crow in the Snowy Wood. Larger than any Lost boy. Larger than the largest Pirate. And if he wanted he could be louder than anyone too. Solomon was a voice of reason and always did his best to look out for the boys of the Snowy Wood, despite himself. It was very tiring being Solomon, trying to bring reason to so many unreasonable, ungrateful, unfaithful humans.
Slightlybeing familiar with Solomon's fierce lectures on responsibility and empathyscampered off. Curly grabbed his cutlass and chased after, leaving Nibs to bear the brunt of Solomon's tirade.
"Is that any way to act? You could have killed that boy with how you were choking him." Solomon cawed.
"GOOD! I WANT HIM DEAD!" shouted Nibs out in the direction Curly ran.
Solomon wasn't impressed, "What's your name, boy?"
Nibswhile still angryrealized he was a might bit scared of big, black-eyed Solomon, "Nibs" he answered.
"I know life can be hard, Nibs, but it's even harder to live if you don't treat your brothers with respect and kindness" lectured Solomon.
"Those aren't brothers of mine!" snapped Nibs, "Treat them with respect? With kindness!? They would've killed me! He put that sword of his to my neck! Should I let him slit my throat? Should I let them turn out my pockets?!" Nibs turned and stomped away.
"Listen to me" cawed Solomon, hopping along behind Nibs. "I understand you want to hurt others for having been hurt. Your brothers feel the same. But think of that world where everyone is inflicting pain on everyone else. In that world we are all wounded and hurting one another. How can anyone ever heal in such a violent world? You need to be brave and withstand your pain without inflicting it back on your brothers. Could you do that, Nibs? Could you be the brave one to stop the back and forth of violence? Can you be brave?"
Nibs was sick of being followed by Solomon and so told him what he wanted to hear, "Sure, I'll be brave."
Solomonsatisfied in seemingly having gotten through to Nibsflew off back to his perch but Nibs idea of bravery wasn't at all the same as Solomon's. Nibs decided he needed a cutlass of his very own to protect himself with.</p></li>

-My Way, Limp Bizkit
___
You are a pro wrestler. One of the best there have ever been. You had a long lineage of wins and losses. Heartaches and achievements. All in all, you have a had a career worth looking back on.
But you have never reached the top of the mountain. You have never held the title that defined your promotions. And you want it so bad.
Still, its like they say. The spirits willing. The body cannot. You have been wrestling for so long and your body is telling you too long. Telling you its time to string up your boots and finally call it a day.
But not until you have won that title.
____
My Way is a game about obsession, burnout and the idea of work defining you. Its about pushing yourself far beyond what you know you should be doing. Its about the pain of reaching for the top.
My Way is heavily inspired by pro wrestling of all sorts. But most of all, its inspired by Independent Wrestling. Its where I have seen the most sheer passion and love for wrestling anywhere. Even too much.
This game was created as part of the Wretched & Alone Jam, a game jam organised to coincide with the release of the SRD for the Wretched & Alone system, based on Chris Bissettes game The Wretched.

When a player character takes an action thats plausible in the fiction, the Judge will determine the worlds reaction. If the player accepts these consequences, the action occurs. The Judge determines the worlds reaction based on the established fiction, and the characters Favor with the four Factions in the game - Townsfolk, Politicians, Businessmen and Outlaws.Favoris an indicator of how well-respected, heeded, adored, or tolerated a players character is by a particular Faction. Favor is represented by different colors of poker chips for each Faction. Player actions during the game will cause them to earn as well as lose Favor with these Factions. The higher a players Favor, the more likely it is that members of the Faction will react positively to them. A character trying to quell an angry crowd of Townsfolk will have a much different reaction with two chips of Favor than with five. 
As important as Favor is, it only applies to interactions with non-player characters. When player characters act upon each other, they engage theNegotiationmechanic. Much like with Favor, a player takes an action and is told the consequences necessary to make it true. In this case, rather than the Judge, it is the acted-upon player who determines the consequences. The acting player may accept, refuse, or continue to negotiate. Everything in the game, fictional and mechanical, is open to Negotiation and the acted-upon player should say what they truly want in order to allow the action to happen. This may be a little or a lot. It may be more than the acting player wants to give. The two players should try in earnest to find an agreed upon price, but if none can be found then the Judge takes over and narrates what happens - most often to the detriment of both characters. Seco Creek is no place for inaction.</p></li>

<p>I've been working really hard on an (in my opinion) fantastic new gothic/haunted tileset. You can use it foranything from a castle, to a dungeon, maybe even a huanted mansion. It has a bunch of carefully crafted animations to add plenty of life to your project or game, take a look at the gif included on the page for just a few.
I'll shortly be adding more tile variations, items (coins, hearts, ect.), and hopefully some animated enemies, but it's already a great little set.

As always, I'm open to suggestions and I'm happy to help tailor any of my tilesets to your project/needs!</p></li>

<p>The Fool's Journey is a storytelling game based on a deck of tarot cards. Nine of the Major Arcana cards form a story waiting to be told. Bid against the other players to rearrange the cards into the story you want. Then use the cards as prompts to tell the tale of the Fool (or another character). Try the game with different tarot decks for different stories and different experiences. There is no end to the stories waiting in The Fool's Journey.
All you need to play is this instruction book, two to four players, a bunch of 6-sided dice, and any deck of tarot cards.</p></li>

<p>A bundle of scripts and an object that allows you to connect your game to Twitch chat super easily! For the most basic application, you can interact with Twitch chat using just 3 scripts (plus your own custom handler script) to connect and send/receive chat messages.
Main Features
Super easy to use (You only need to use a minimum of 3 scripts for basic functionality)Flexible - Sending chat messages is easy, but you can also send and handle any Twitch IRC command (seehttps://dev.twitch.tv/docs/ircfor info!)Asynchronous command handlingAutomatic PING->PONG and reconnection (if connection is lost)Safely supports both blocking and non-blocking socket connectionsAutomatic rate limiting to reduce Global Ban riskMany other commands to make the system more powerful (Capability requests, tag management, special string unescaping, command queueing and more)Marked debug messages to help you track what's going on (and you can disable them when you need to!)Theoretically works on all export platformsincluding HTML5
Currently versions for both GameMaker: Studio 1.4 and GameMaker Studio 2 are available
Check out the Quick Reference and Basic Guide to get help setting up (or at least an idea of what the extension is about)
You can get an oauth key for your account quickly here:https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
The video guide also provides similar instructions, as well as some slightly more advanced usage. It covers basic connection, message sending and parsing, making a chat-interactive "Guess the Number" game and a couple of other things.
(Warning! I'm a little socially awkward, but I hope the cute bird makes up for it a little. It's 30 minutes long, but you only really need the first 7 minutes to get set up receiving and sending commands, as well as connecting- the rest is more useful, but non-essential stuff)
New in v1.1.0 (GMS2 Only)

twitch_check_connected() can now return 3 possible values from the enum "public_twitch_connection_status" ("connected", "not_connected" and "attempting_connection"). It will still work as a true/false test as before, but now you can check if you're connected but not logged in yet with "public_twitch_connection_status.attempting_connection"oauth failures now cause a disconnect. 
"twitch_set_disconnect_callback_script" has been added so you can set a script to handle unexpected disconnects, which will be passed 1 argument containing a value from the "public_twitch_disconnect_reasons" enum.
Information about these enums and functions has been added to the quick reference
COOL NEW FACT!! As of GameMaker Studio 2 IDE v2.2.3.425, you can now import "Local Asset Packages". Luckily, this already works with the .yymp already provided, so now it's easier to add this to your project then ever!
It is unlikely this asset will function with the Free versions of GameMaker
The 1.4 version will not receive any updates (except maybe bugfixes) as official support for the IDE ended. Also, for some reason, the non-blocking connect never succeeded for me (it works fine in Studio 2 though.</p></li>

<p>In Words, Wilting you and a friend will take the role of two young lovers of the same age whose love must be concealed. To aid in this, the lovers have created a way to communicate secretly through flowers adorning their outfits, inspired by the Victorian floral language of love.
Play consists of you selecting index cards, each featuring a flower from the language you create together, and interpreting the card the other player selected, hoping to remember the hidden meaning you crafted together. You then create a scene together around what the cards meant and if the lovers remembered the language they made.

You, along with the othermembers, are fighting to keep it running, but all the discussion, arguing, andorganizing takes a toll on your health. You must keep your spirits up, whiledealing with life on the side.This game endeavours to give you a well-rounded experience where you canexplore difficult feelings in a safe environment. At the same time, this game canoffer a way out of the hardship that it deals you, or at least make the idea offacing that hardship by yourself less scary"

A review
Brent Jans (@DorklordCanada) reviewed the game for his video series, #ReadIndieRPGs, saying:
...I really do like games that can show us how to act, can model good behavior, can model best practices so that we can then take that into our own lives, and use those skills . I love roleplaying games that do that, and I think 'Keeping the Lights On' is a perfect example of that type of game.

<p>On January 1st, I challenged myself to design, develop, and publish a complete game in 1 month. This is that game.
The original idea was to tell a somewhat cliche RPG story with one critical change: You play as the monsters.
Ozymandias is an imp living in the valley near Detritiville. He's a scavenger; searching caves and battlefields for loot and equipment that he can sell and buy supplies, but when he finds an old book with a powerful aura, he is drawn into a quest that spans the continent to uncover the mystery of the book's origins.
I know it's nothing spectacular and it uses mostly premade assets, but hopefully it makes up for that with solid map design and writing.
Thank you for coming on this journey with me.
Features:Approx. 8-10 hours of dungeon-crawling adventure.Fun and creative story with deep lore and interesting characters.No lootboxes.No pay-to-win BS.3 different endings.
Controls quick guide:Z, Space, Enter-Confirm, select actions, talk to people, interact with objectsX, Esc-Cancel commands,back out of options, open the menuQ/W- Quick switch through characters on equip/status screenShift- makes the character dash, except on the overworld mapArrow Keys- MoveAlt+Enter- Full Screen</p></li>

<p>My Haunted Doll is a 2D Survival Horror game based on the story of the cursed doll of the 1800s which is said to be possessed by the spirits of the little girl and the Devil.

Mary, the owner of the Mary Co. museum, loves to collect ancient antiques, clothes, dolls, bones and utensils. Every Saturday, she goes to a nearby antique store to buy ancient stuff in order to add them to her collections in her museum. On 20th September, she went to the shop to buy an ancient cursed doll. She was a skeptic and did not believe in ghosts until she experienced the paranormal activities herself. As soon as she brought the doll to her museum the things started to take a darker turn. Her museum was on the ground floor while she lived on the fourth floor and the rest three floors were empty. But she started experiencing paranormal activities including things getting misplaced, poltergeist activities and nightmare. A few days following the incident she started researching the history behind the doll and discovered that the doll was cursed. She was desperately in search of the remedy of the situation but she came to know that the only way to stop the paranormal activities was to get rid of the doll and sending it over to its previous location where the doll was originally kept and the curse would be lifted.
However, it is easier said than done. The Devil residing inside the doll will try to stop Mary from achieving her goal. Will she be able to lift the curse, placed on her? Her fate is in your hands now.

Key Features:

Explore the Museum for the proof of the paranormal.
Demons are lurking in the shadows.
Experience the poltergeist activities and nightmarish illusions.
Face your fears while exploring the building and unknown locations.
Nearly half an hour duration of the paranormal investigation.

Note from developer: I am a solo indie game developer and I have created all of the graphics, artwork, animation, character design and programming myself.
Note For YouTuber: If you are a YouTuber and want to make lets play videos about this game feel free to create as many videos as you want. But please mention that this game is available on Itchio. That would be sufficient. Thank you!</p></li>

<li><a href="https://wheeltreepress.itch.io/the-stars-whisper">https://wheeltreepress.itch.io/the-stars-whisper</a>
<p>Note: If you have ideas for how to play TSW during social distancing, we'd love to hear them. I could imagine playing it online with everyone in the dark, save their flashlight, and everyone only being able to text-chat with 2 other stars (and the facilitator). That seems like it would work well.The Stars Whisper is a live action role-playing game (LARP) whereparticipants play the stars in a constellation, shining for millennia in the night sky. Participants will discuss and contemplate philosophical questions, such asthe nature of truth, the meaning ofexistence, or the definition of love with each other, as they light up the void of space.
The game is for 8-12 people and a facilitator. It requires a room where you can turn off or dim the lights, flashlights, and the ability to print character sheets for players. It takes about 90 minutes to 2 hours to complete. The booklet features all the information needed to play, including safety techniques, rules for the players, rules for the facilitator, and character sheets.
The game is designed to be quiet, subtle, still, and meditative, and may summon up feelings of joy, melancholy, connectedness, loneliness, and introspectiveness in players. It is for people interested in pondering philosophical questions, having a contemplative experience, exploring connections with others in a unique way, or who just think that being a star for an hour sounds kind of fun.
When you purchase the game, you get (a) a PDF of the game, (b) a printer friendly PDF of the game, and (c) the character sheets, included in both documents.</p></li>

<p>14 hours from now: Your thumbs mash the smooth buttons of your gamepad, as a bead of sweat drips down your forehead. The smell of pizza rolls burning fills the air.

<p>SOMETIMES A GUY JUST DOESN'T WANT TO STAND OUT
But sometimes that isn't so easy. It definitely isn't for Diego Foxglove, a 6'4'' former drug dealer who sprouts mutant mouths and turns into a giant wolf-dog to fight killer alien fungus. If it's not the vague specter of society looking down on him for being an immigrant, an Excentric, or both, it's faces from his tangled past coming back to quite literally give him grief. Diego wants nothing more than to keep his head down and away from the many things troubling him, but that seems all but impossible.
Except it isn't- because as it turns out, Diego has one more ability that he never knew about. A different form. Something smaller, more inconspicuous, more... fluffy?

Tales from the Road  Furry Interactive Fiction-MadeinTwine 
Tales from the Road is a furry slice of life interactive fiction game. The game features a story about a disgruntled freelance worker who's grown bored of their work. Seeking to do something different with their life, they come up with the idea to go on an excursion across the country.   
The game is currently in development and still has some time to go until I would consider it "finished". Despite this, theres still a decent amount of content currently available. With the total time to complete the game being around 1-3 hours in its current state. Depending on how much dialogue you exhaust and the choices you make.
So, what's in the game currently? 
Right now, the current chapters just lay the groundwork for this eventually excursion across the country. They introduce and develop the core cast of characters, while also providing a bit of backstory for the player character.   
Chapter 3, the last chapter before the road trip starts, was just recently completed. In this chapter you start making the final plans for the road trip. Doing things such as mapping out your stops, finding a way to fund the road trip, and deciding on your passengers. You also get to interact with some of the already established characters, which includes the option of going on a date with one of two characters.
  
Chapter 4, which is the start of the road trip, is currently being worked on. For the latest info on chapter 4, see the devlogs.   
How's the game played? 
The game is played in your standard Twine environment, which is to say it's mostly text-based. At the start, youll be asked to make your character and pick a name and race (Wolf, Lion, Fox, or Dragon). From there on youll be able to navigate the world, make choices, and go through dialogue by selecting certain inputs. See screenshots for examples if they show up.
  
No combat, since that didnt fit with my view of what I wanted this game to be.
Some of the characters do have artwork. But right now it's only two of them, Holly and Sasha. I do plan on getting the other two main side characters commissioned sometime soon.
 All artwork was done by the fantastic kasscabel. Check out her Twitter page here or her Fiverr page here ifyoulikethe character art she made.
What kind of content is in the game? 
This game is mostlysafe for work. There is swearing and some things that could be considered suggestive. Nothing crazy though.
Boring stuff 
If you encounter any bugs, feel free to let me know in the comments section. Even if you didn't have any problems, I'd appreciate hearing any feedback you might have! Just post it on here via a rating or comment. Helps let me know if I'm doing stuff right.
Tales from the Road will always be available for free on here. I'm not forcing someone to pay for a game some idiot made in his spare time. Donations are on for the standalone download if that's something you'd be interested in. Welcomed but not expected blah blah blah you know how it is.
If you want, follow me here on Twitter. I'll post stuff about the game on there.  Also see the devlog page for the latest information on updates and the status of the game.
Hope you enjoy the game!

a game about looking at a tree and thinking about norms of the society
[version franaise ici]

two seeds for a solo game where you write a letter

First, take one six-sided dice (1D6) and choose don't cut the tree or be the tree.
Then, read this game before going out or doing activities (maybe the morning before work, or before taking the train/bus to see a friend, or just before you go for a walk). Do your stuff, activity or work without forgetting this game because you'll play when you get home. 
At home, youll need a pen and a sheet of paper. If you want to play the both seeds, please allow time to pass between each part : the best is to wait 1 day, but you can also just doing something else during one hour before playing the second seed.

author: angela quidam. I released this first version under the 
CC-BY-SAlicence. This game is actually a ttrpg Im thinking about 
transform it into a sort of pnp cardgame. Maybe.
illustrations: trees made by Vertexcat [itch.io]software used for layout: ScribusWHERE DOES THE IDEA CAME FROM

This game is my submission for the Pride Month gamejam. First, I 
wanted to make a game only about asexuality, then opened to every
orientation , then the idea has grown again to finish into this two-letters-game(s). I 
recommend queer people to play dont cut the tree and straight people 
to play be the tree, but please play as you like (or read the all 
document: only 2 pages ;) ). You can also play one of the game, and give
 the letter to someone else with the second game, so this person could 
answer to your letter.

If you play the game and write a letter, I should be happy to 
have your opinion on this game and your feelings during it. As the 
letter could become really personal, I would understand if you keep it 
for you. Just share your feelings about the game INSPIRATIONSQuill (Scott Malthouse), A wish for something better (Sorry not sorry
 games), Spoons (The Falling Dream), Brave Sparrow (Avery Alder), and I 
guess a lot of other games I read but never play; as a lot of random 
generator I saw but never used.

<p>On a sunny day, Lil Viv and her Uncle Bob visited the forest, where Viv saw a mysterious mansion. Not thinking twice, she went into the abandoned house before Bob could even try to stop her. Standing in the hallway, the floor under their feet suddenly broke down. Viv and Bob fell into the basement, not knowing what will happen next.
Viv and Bob is a puzzle game made with GB Studio 1.1 where you play Viv and Bob, trying to exit the many rooms of the mansion's basement. While Bob is strong enough to push blocks to their designated places, Lil Viv is light enough to walk above insecure parts of the floor. Bob and Viv are trapped in two sides of a mirror. The room Bob is standing in is a mirrored version of Viv's room and vice versa. Actions on one side of the mirror affect the other side as well. Switch between both protagonists and always think about both sides of the mirror.
This is a game for the original Game Boy. The download contains a Game Boy ROM.The ROM can be played on emulators or even a real Game Boy if you are using a flashcart. 
The current Version 1.0 of the game contains a set of levels. I will try to add more levels with Version 1.1. Moreover I will try to add some cutscenes and a animated prologue and epilouge. Obviously I will also fix bugs if I find them.
English is not my native language. If you find any text errors in my game, please let me know so I can fix them.
I hope you will enjoy my little game!</p></li>

<p>This a space fantasy adventure hack of Tunnel Goons, as my entry for GoonJam.
This is mostly bits and pieces of another game I was working on, Ventures thruRealms and Beyond, but have decided to delay for better development.
This version is playable already, but I will update it with my additional rules for commuting in a busy growing galaxy before GoonJam ends.*Narrator Cue: That update never released before Goon Jam ended*UPDATE: Ok, that was my b, life happened, but I will continue developing this game. So just hang tight, goons.</p></li>

<p>Cascadio plays like a fast-paced Sudoku. Arrange cascading flows of numbers to complete this mind bending puzzle of sums.
Cascadio is inspired by a Hydrology algorithm which maps the flow of water on land. Flow one tile to another to match the goals of each tile. The value of tiles upstream cascades all the way downstream.
Simple to learn, difficult to master with endless puzzles.
Controls:- Drag to connect. - Click to Disconnect. - Match all goals to win. </p></li>

<p>Fullscreen recommended.
Draw Nine puts you in the role of a magician whose powers depend on a pack of magic cards. These can help or harm, but the selection available to you is determined randomly at the start of the game. Since you cannot choose your cards, you must find the path through the world that makes the most of the powers at your disposal.

<p>Fight ghosts and ghosts from your past.

It's been a long month for Sirius- not talking to most of your friends, having an angry ex talk about you behind your back, and having a friend claim... that her house is haunted? The past few weeks have been long for Hailey as well, as her house has seemingly become infested with ghosts that only she can see- that is, until a fateful day.
Image of Perfection is a creepy, atmospheric RPG about confronting fears- rather than being a pure horror game, it's a story-driven RPG about accepting who you are.

Alpha Demo Features:
20~ minutes longSeveral battlesSeveral ways to go about things
We're calling this an "alpha" demo as we still have many changes we want to make (fleshing out rooms more, improving combat, adding more choices, etc.) but we want to hear feedback and any bugs from players!

A simple & peaceful game about growing flowers with bouncy drops of water!

There's a *lot* here I'd still like to iterate on/improve/fix in this at a later date, so I'd say this is technically somewhere between a Prototype and an Alpha/Beta. But for now, I hope this serves as an enjoyable enough proof-of-concept!
Some stuff I'd like to focus on in a possible future update:
Improve the "droplet trajectory/preview" to make it more useful to the player and convey more information. Currently, it's a bit harder than it should be to predict the angle that droplets will bounce in.Add to and refine the core mechanics. I decided to keep it simple for now, but there is plenty of room for improvement. For example, adding some way to "earn back" your turns on some levels.Significantly improve on and balance the levels. This is a big one! Many (if not most)levels are far more difficult to "Full Clear" than they have any right to be, sometimes frustratingly so. (Also, many of the minimum clear goals may be lower than they probably should be, that's another thing to iron out eventually)\Add support for Mouse inputand other input-related features (custom controls, joystickdeadzone, etc..)Lots of bugfixing, optimizing, and polishing!Releases for Mac, Linux, maybe HTML5? (Or even mobile? Who knows!)And most important of all, unlockable cosmetics for Cloudy!!!
Version 1.1is a tiny patch that fixes a few bugs (an audio issue, and a soft-lock that was possible in one level) plus the ability to get back to the MainMenu from the Map screen.</p></li>

Featured onRE:BIND.ioand IndieGamesPlus.
In a distant future in which capitalism and consumerism have continued to run rampant, corporations have replaced all government, and planet Earth has long been relegated to legend, society constantly moves to new planets and throws away the old ones like last year's model of smartphone.
You are a guest at the launch party for the most recently developed planet: Arcadia. Over the course of the evening youwill wander the Arcadia Botanical Gardens' various rooms and eavesdrop on the other distinguished guests whose stories and dramas play out in a repeating cycle.
The Gardens claim to recreate the natural world of "prelaunch" Earth, a world no one has experienced in thousands of years. The game explores humanity's relationship to nature under capitalism, speculating on what "nature" would look when completely constructed by humans, and prompting the question of how close we may already be to such a reality.
I studied media studies at Vassar College, class of 2018, and this game was originally created as my senior thesis.You can learn more about the theory behind Even in Arcadia in my thesis's written component, which you can download from the link on mywebsite:https://girldebordgames.myportfolio.com/even-in-arcadia

<p>Discsphere

About the game, the ramble-y, not so formalversion:
( Feel free to skip to the short version if you're short on time or already know what the game is about.)
Discsphere is an easy-to-learn sports game where your objective is to throw a sphere at your opponent. The catch? You have to capture 3 goals with discs before you can throw spheres. You can also throw power discs on a cooldown timer to stun your opponent, or to remove ownership of an opponent's goal.
Oh, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the dodge rolls, activated by tapping a movement key in multiplayer and by pressing the dedicated dodge roll key in single-player.
Did I mention the game has a single-player mode? It has a single-player mode. The single-player mode has a story and boss battles, and even has two final bosses depending on how you go about defeating the bosses.
Oh yeah, when you first play the game, please play the tutorial first! The game does not play very conventionally, so you'll need to understand how everything works before you begin! Even if you remap the controls, that won't really explain everything there is to know.


About the game, the short, somewhat more formal version:
( Feel free to skip right to downloading the game if you already know what the game is about.)
Discsphere is a sports game about capturing goals which also has elements of dodgeball. The game has a conventional multiplayer mode and a boss-battle-focused unconventional single-player mode, which both have slightly different controls. Playing the tutorial before playing the game for your first timeis recommended. Just remapping the controls isn't enough to understand how everything works here.

The obligatory features list:
Single-player and multiplayer modes!Keyboard controls with support for remapping!*A dedicated dodge roll button, only in the single-player mode!**Two ways to win:Hit your opponent with a sphere,or have more goals than your opponent when times runs out!Multiple stage layout options in multiplayer, including the option to randomly cycle between stages after every point scored!Several songs, randomly cycled in the multiplayer mode and carefully picked to be relevant in the single-player mode!***You play as a knight in the single-player mode!! I mean,why not!!!Boss battles!Asort of overworld segment thing for the single-player mode between the boss battles!This gives you a breather between bosses.Two final bosses, the arguably harder one requiring you to win by time against every boss in the game!A generally speaking highly experimental design!You can turn off music with Control+M! (You can't un-mute it immediately but Shift+M will make music play once more the next time the game changes scenes.)
*There are programs out there if you need to play this with a controller. Sorry, goodcontroller support is really hard to code and even harder to code for more than one player with the engine I'm using in mind.;_;Game development can be hard,,,
**I didn't think to add this until part-way through the game's development and with how the keyboard remapping works, it would've been difficult to add this
***Some of the songs only play in the single-player mode.

A note from the developer:
Hey guys, this is a note from Adam. Not going to be joking around quite as much as I did with most of the rest of this page. Maybe I'll throw in a joke or two for those of you who otherwise might not read something like this.
First of all, thanks for considering playing my game. It does mean something to me. ^_^
Second off, Imade this game because another project of mine was... well, it was going well, technically speaking. But Ineeded a break. I burned myself out on it. So to take my mind off of all of that, Ikind of just sat back somewhat unproductively. But then an idea for a sports video game popped into my head.
Which is strange, sports video games aren't usually exactly a genre Isee myself playing much. But the idea sounded like fun, and sounded simple enough to make, so I set out to make it. And here we are now.
Honestly, most of the time went into making the single-player mode. Most of the multiplayer content was done less than a week after the game's development started, and the last-minute addition of alternate stage layouts only took maybe 15 minutes of work.
Despite that, I really hope you can give both the single-player and the multiplayer a fair shake. The game was designed for multiplayer first and foremost, with the single-player coming later. If you don't have somebody to play with locally, there's programs out there for playing local multiplayer games in online multiplayer.
If you need help finding such a program, well, might Irecommend Parsec?http://parsecgaming.com
Anyways, because this game is so experimental in its design, I didn't wanna charge people up-front for the game. I don't know who this game is for, if anybody,and I don't feel like anybody will know for sure until they've already played it. To that end, you can download the game for free. I recommend you do so at first. I don't want you to feel ripped off.
However, if you like the game, a donation would be appreciated. $1 if you feel like you got some fun out of it, and $5 if you feel like you really liked it, sounds like a fair value to me, but feel free to go higher or lower as you wish. Just... please don't over-do it, only put in the money if you can actually afford it!
Whatever the case may be, regardless of whether you put in money or not,I hope you enjoy the game! ^v^
~Adam

Extra stuff for paying more:
If you put in $5, you get an added bonus in the form of high and low quality soundtrack downloads!The MP3 version sounds incredibly wrong though, it's mostly included as a joke, I recommend using the OGG soundtrack for most purposes and the FLAC soundtrack if you don't mind downloading a larger file like that. There's also a file included that includes every version of the soundtrack, just in case you were hoping to download them all anyways.
There aren't any incentives for paying any more than that (at least, not yet),but as Isaid earlier, feel free to pay more if you want to!

One last thing of note:
We also have a press kit available for the game. Currently, you can download it in ZIP format here:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eJw2xDFJ1hoYJHvpZ-fSoB90ze4WRZ3m/view?usp=shari...</p></li>

<p>It's been a year since Survey Team 4 landed on Osiris 4. They reported a peaceful planet with the highest density of life signs ever detected. And then .... nothing. No response to communications, no emergency beacons, nothing at all. What happened to them?
What happened to Survey Team 4?is the third chapter in my One day at a time series. The series was begun as a means for me to practice coming up with simple games. I set myself a few rules to try and ensure they games stay simple:
I get 20 hrs to develop and upload each game.No individual game can be released until the collection is complete.Once all games are complete I get 4 additional hours per game to polish them.All games are done solo but I can use third party assets.
With the rules in place the question was then what would I use as prompts? I decided on working my way through all of the Global Game Jam themes in order. What happened to Survey Team 4?is based on the 2011 theme of "extinction".</p></li>

<p>THE FROST PAPERS
"The Ouija Board of Roleplaying Games" - Occult Victorian parlor games for those who love paranormal investigation and ghost stories.
There is nothing quite like them. The Papers combine elements of live action roleplaying games, mass hypnosis as performed by stage magicians, the guided meditations of Tibetan monks, and sances of turn of the century spiritual mediums.
Each game promises an immersive night of supernatural exploration for you and group of friends, placing you at the center of a real life ghost story.
The games are each unique, guiding you through a series of sance-like paranormal investigations. 
Each of the ten games is connected to the next, following the story of the mysterious Mr. Frost and his own experiments over a hundred years ago.
They let you follow his footsteps as carefully as you can to unveil clues about the strange realm called the Grey beyond the Fog and the Shadowman that stalks it.
There are no scripts, no actors, and no props. These games provide you the framework to have genuine frightening experiences heavy with occult and supernatural theme.
Its the closest thing to being in a supernatural horror movie youll ever experience.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://txori.itch.io/omeganaut">https://txori.itch.io/omeganaut</a>
<p>You are the last pilot of the Earth Alliance, our only resort: the Omeganaut!
What I intend to do with Omeganaut is to create a roguelike kind of game out of a 3D Rail Shooter. I take inspiration from Starfox (Super Nintendo) and from classic arcade shooters.

Features
Fast paced gameplay with randomly generated levelsNo loading time, no cuts between levelsVR : Put on your favorite headset and play the game in glorious 3DSmall footprint : the entire game can fit inside a good old floppy disk

How to play?
It is recommended to play Omeganaut using a gamepad with analog joystick. But you can also play with a digital pad, a keyboard or even a touchscreen. Just activate the virtual gamepad in the Setup screen.
Move around to avoid obstaclesOnly one button to fire and destroy everything that comes in your wayPress the roll buttons to turn fasterDouble tap the roll button to DO A BARREL ROLL!(Barrel rolls are handy to avoid danger and to slap nearby obstacles)

Virtual Reality
You can turn on VR in the Setup screen. I only have a Google Cardboard, but maybe it will work with fancy headsets such as Oculus Rift? Please give me feedback if you have the chance to play with such a device!


Working
Not working :(




Google CardboardSamsung Gear VRHTC ViveOculus Rift / Quest





Development note
Omeganaut is still under construction, using the awesome ZGameEditor engine, which allows a tiny footprint, and two externallibraries forphysics and modular music.By buying the game, you help me continue making it. Right now, I focus on making the engine good and getting rid of all the bugs, while adding new enemy ships now and then. When there will be enough content, Ill focus on writing rules in order to produce nice levels instead of spawning everything randomly.The downside of atiny footprint is that a fewantivirus software will go nuts and return a false positive.This is a known problem and it's very annoying for me...You can read the fulldiscussion about that pesky problem here:http://www.emix8.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1339

Mask up. Spill blood. Drink the Rich.
The world is not as it should be. The rich feed, literally, upon the poor, as blood-sucking vampires who barely bother to conceal their horrific, parasitic nature. The downtrodden peoples of the world struggle under the burdens of rent, payable through the sweat of their labor or the blood of their veins. Evil has triumphed. Many have given in to despair. But all is not lost.
In Brinkwood, you take on the role of renegades, thieves, and rebels struggling for freedom and liberation in a castylpunk world controlled by vampires. Radicalized by tragedy, you have taken up arms and fled into the forests, where you were taken in by unlikely allies - the fae, forgotten creatures of myth - who offered a different path and the means to fight back against your oppressors. 
Masks, forged of old wood and older magic, are the final tool left to fight a war long ago lost. If you wear them, they will take their price, etching themselves upon your very soul. But they will also let you spill the blood of the rich and powerful vampires that now rule the land, and from that blood strengthen yourself and your movement.

<p>The experience of waiting is universal and in many senses a uniquely human one. When adventure is promised and withheld, what becomes of the would-be hero? When their only companion is endless time and one another, what becomes of the noble adventuring party or crew of scoundrels? In a world of heroic adversity, how does a hero deal with the absurdity of being stuck in a small and hostile space?
Enter the Finest: the worst establishment in the world. There will be no music, drinks or friendly strangers; there may be fights, but they will only make your stay here more miserable. Worst of all, there is no exit. This is limbo, and you're in it for the long haul. Perhaps you'll come out friends on the other side. Maybe you'll even learn something about yourself in the Finest's exquisite desolation.
In short, have you ever wanted to replicate the experience of No Exit or Waiting for Godot as a prelude to your adventure? Have you ever wanted to define the space before the adventure begins? Are you interested in taking perhaps the most humanizing act of characterization possible, having to wait with no other recourse? Maybe you think you'd enjoy a game about being strictly confined and essentially disempowered. All of these, it turns out, can be surprisingly fun.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://naive-star.itch.io/saudade">https://naive-star.itch.io/saudade</a>
<p>A
cozy game about rediscovering the past.

You
are an immortal being able to travel through space. You left your
home once you were of age, just like those around you. In your
travels, you met new people and new places, those experiences shape
who you are. Even when the path was met with hardship, you had the
will to keep going.

But
now you miss home.

Maybe
its okay to go back.

Saudade
is a map-drawing narrative game to be played solo or with friends. It
is about finding value in a past altered by time.

The
word Saudade
is portuguese for a feeling of deep longing for something, it is to
miss intensely, but it is most often than not a positive feeling, the
certainty that what is no longer here will always be with us.

<p>I stood there in the dark, and gazed up at it. The sheer bulk of the thing, an unbelievable complexity of glass and rivets and polished steel, hydraulic pistons and copper tubing that glinted in my lanterns light. A peculiar sensation came over me then, and I felt as if I were looking up at a giant wave about to crash down and drag me into the depths.
And now, as I sit in my study with the plans for the Engine laid out before me, I fear I may have been right.
The Gateshead Engine is a single-player game set in an alternate version of Victorian England. In it, youll take on the role of an engineer creating a steam-powered mecha for a powerful patron, chronicling your progress, thoughts, and fears in your diary as you go. It can be played in a single session (set aside at least an hour) or split across several nights of play.

<li><a href="https://xavid.itch.io/convergent">https://xavid.itch.io/convergent</a>
<p>Tetrana is a small but ancient and prosperous kingdom. Its most distinctive feature is its strong caste system, which divides every individual into a rigid caste based on affinity to one of the four elements: Air, Fire, Water, or Earth. Each caste has rigidly defined roles and a strict place in the social hierarchy.
Most unusually, however, every 100 years a mystical Convergence of the four elements reshapes the structure of Tetranan society, allowing the caste hierarchy to be realigned! This is obviously a most important event, and you are privileged to represent one of the four castes at the Convergence, with the power to determine if a Realignment will occur. You do this, of course, by using your elemental gems to summon your spirit butterfly. Because everything about Tetrana makes perfect sense.
Of course, it'd be highly improper for anyone to pretend to be a member of a caste they are not, and especially so at such an important event that will decide the future of the country for the next century. So you have every assurance that everyone is exactly who they appear to be.
"The Importance of Being Convergent" is a short game of politics, secret identities, and romance, but primarily ridiculousness. It won 2nd place in the Iron GM contest at Intercon N. It is optimized more for roleplaying, humor, and dramatic scenes than for cutthroat competition, and has few mechanics.

<p>You had a lot of fun when you were alive. You stole whatever you wanted, loved many a partner, murdered anyone who ever tried to get in your way. When it came to the untamed West, you bowed your head to no religion, law, or social nicety.NowOld Scratch has invited you and your friends to wager in a game of his creation.
Now you are chained to a card table with a few others who were in the running for worst person alive in a room lit by walls of fire.Turns out, Old Scratch is none other than the Devil himself, and y'all are playing for your very souls. Whoever wins will leave rich beyond their wildest dreams. Whoever loses wont leave at all. Will you profit from the misery of others? Give the Devil his due? Just remember:It's not about winning. It's about making everyone else lose.
Scratch's Sc0re is a Rummy game in the style of Three Thirteen and Five Crowns. Make groups of cards called Talons out of your hand, while keeping more chips than your opponents. Clear first in a round and you can force the player you think did worst to pay up.Or wait for someone else to end the round and try to nab the ever-growing Score by bringing Old Scratch the card he most wants. Just be careful - every time someone claims The Score, it grows exponentially!
Everything you need to play is included, besides up to five other people and a way to keep score (such as poker chips or tokens). Contains fronts and backs for all 100 cards in the base set (which you'll need to cut out and sleeve in clear sleeves).*****************************************************************************************If you'd want something nice, but money could be holding you back, Old Scratch wants to invite you to grab the black-and-white, reduced art PnP for absolutely nothing! It's called the "Homebound Edition" and is located as a demo down below.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://akselmo.itch.io/penance">https://akselmo.itch.io/penance</a>
<p>You're the Damned One, a reptilian Fallen Holy Warrior, seeking for Penance to atone for your sins against your kind. You have been given a task: Go through the gates of Hell and destroy all the sin you can see. 
You start with your sword and pistol, and you will find more weapons in the corners of Hell.
Show them your Holy Fury, and only then you shall be redeemed.

Penance is an oldschool style FPS with a campaign mode with hand made levels, and an endless mode with procedurally generated levels covered in  gritty retro graphics. You play as anthropomorphic lizard templar dude (look I like lizards okay). 
The campaign mode features five (or six if you count the very first one) hand made levels, and a bossfight.
The goal of the endless mode is simple: Cause enough carnage and earn points from each kill, collect keys each level to get through the portals, then show off your highscore to your friends. 
The game has a Discord support, so people can see your score while playing and also which campaign level you are on. If you get high enough score, you will get the ending cutscene. Penance also has simple bunnyhopping that increases your speed, crouch-sliding and a rage mechanic, that when activated, gives you double damage to all weapons, except the sword does quadruple damage.

Default Controls:
WASD - MovementSpacebar - JumpLeft mouse button - ShootRight mouse button - ZoomScrollwheel and number keys - Change weaponQ - Activate rage when yellow bar is 100
Controls should be able to be remapped from game launcher.
I haven't tested controller with this game, it was created for mouse and keyboard in mind.

This game was simply made for fun, because it's something I felt like I wanted to play and I love oldschool style FPS games. It's probably not that difficult game for FPS players, but I am proud of this game and I find it fun and satisfying to play. Due to the overwhelming popularity I also made the campaign mode, which let me practice proper level design.
I used a lot of feedback I got from Ironscale and Castle Rodok to make this game, but also learned a lot of new things. I hope you have as much fun playing Penance as I had making it!

<p>a fun dating sim where you get to date stick figures! that might sound dumb, but trust me when i say that the stick figures in question are, like... the SMEXIEST STICK FIGURES EVER. they also have very good and real personalities, just like real people! so really, it's just like dating an actual stick figure! except through a computer screen! so... i guess.. it's just like having an internet boyfriend and/or girlfriend who refuses to show their real face and just uses the avatar of a stick figure! sounds completely great and not suspicious or sketchy at all! 
anyway, what are you waiting for? play this game, unless of course you don't enjoy the experience of having an internet boyfriend and/or girlfriend who refuses to show their real face and just uses the avatar of a stick figure. in which case, there's really nothing for you here. you can leave now.

Sometime in the mid-1980s development began on a technology that, had it gone to market, would have changed video gaming as we know it. A complete virtual-reality system meant for arcades, utilizing twin head-mounted vector monitors of the type used in games such as Battlezone, Tempest and Star Wars.
Sadly, funding for the project dried up before it reached completion, and the first game for the system - VekWars - never saw the light of day, continuing to exist only in rumor and a handful of blurry photographs from the period.
But now a team of digital archaeologists based in Austin, Texas have successfully extracted the source code for this game from a dusty 8-inch floppy disk provided by an anonymous benefactor. We are pleased to present VekWars - fully updated to support modern virtual-reality systems (or non-VR monitors) and playable for the first time in over 35 years!
Note:VekWars is best experienced in VR, but if you're using the itch.io launcher, sometimes it can't find your VR headset.If this is the case, try launching the executable directly.
How To Play
Welcome to the year 2385. Humanity is locked in a deadly war with the evil Xilorian Empire. The key to winning this war lies in the unique properties of Vektrox Ore. Found on only one planet in the galaxy, human mining colonies are under constant attack by invading Xilorian forces.
You are in charge of defending a cache of blue ore crates from waves of Xilorian ships that will attempt to steal them. Your defense turret sits in the middle of a ring of crates, and is equipped with a powerful laser cannon, three missiles, and a shield system to protect you from enemy attacks. Xilorian saucers may appear at any point around you and will fly in and attempt to steal the crates.  Point at them with your targeting reticule and pull the trigger to fire your lasers and destroy them. If an enemy saucer is taking off with a crate, they will drop it if shot, but be careful not to accidentally hit the crate and destroy it yourself! If all crates are lost, then the game is over.
Watch out for red enemy fighters that will fire missiles at your turret. Shoot the missiles before they hit you to avoid losing shield energy. After three direct hits your turret will be destroyed and the game will be over.
Use the secondary fire button to launch a highly-destructive NovaRocket at the enemy.
At the end of each attack wave your turret's energy shield is recharged, and a new NovaRocket provided, up to a maximum of three.
DEFEND THE CRATES!

<p>Guildhall is an archipelago nation, far from the war and politics of the continent, but deeply embroiled in its own struggles... ages ago it was run by the Council of Archmages, but they all died when the world's magic started to slip away, and the islands are trying to hold onto civilization with dying spells and failing artifacts.
Worse, the great Sea Walls have finally fallen, leaving Guildhall open to the beasts from the ocean, where monsters beyond imagination dwell.

<p>Pictassembler is an engineering puzzle game where you set up a production line of marblesand operator blocks to assemble pixel art images one block at a time. Each marble can be stuck to an anchor or an existing pixelblock to create a pixel block in a given location, and can also be shaded appropriately.

Block Out is a top-down shooter with flashy graphics and calm music.
The main feature of this game is game mode creation. This feature allows you to craft your own gameplay experience, by changing most aspects of the game.
Explore 4 differentlevels, choose from 5 differenttypes of enemies, define andmodify their behavior as you wish and make your own personal hell or make a relaxing mode, where the enemies run away from you!
You can save, edit and delete these modes. Make and save as many as you'd like. You can also share the modes you created with your friends very easily. Just generate a code in the edit mode, share it with them, they paste it in their game's edit mode, press a button and voila! (It is intuitive enough but if there are any problems, tell me and I'll try to make it better for ya)
Here are all the things that you can modify :

<p>In a city brimming withsecrets only one individual can cut through the smoke andmake sense of it all.

Enter The Sleuth, a peerless detective and mentalist.
In every lie there exists a kernel of truth. In every stroke of the pen, a hundred words. In a city like Doskvol it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the meaning of it all, to shut the door and allow the trash to pile up underneath the floorboards. The Sleuth knows that a foundation of lies drags everyone down and that is very useful information.
The Sleuth is a custom playbook for Blades in the Dark, by John Harper. Designed to fit right alongside the likes of The Hound, The Leech,or The Spider, The Sleuth is a useful addition to any Crew with more questions than answers.

<p>Summary:
This is a booklet detailingthe construction and operation ofonesideddice for use in a setting agnostic tabletop RPG system.
It might seem silly to play an RPG that only uses one sided dice, but in practice... ...it is indeed quite silly.
Why a D1?
Legends tell of a die that is perfectly weighted, with any face having the exact same chance of being rolled. A die that removes all chance from the equation. Only a skilled crafts-person could construct such a marvelous die, correct? It would certainly seem that way, especially when taking into account the most wondrous feature of this object: it only has one side. In truth though, you can make one in under 10 minutes, using materials you (almost certainty) already own and with only the most basic crafting skills.
What you get:
8 pages (counting covers), black and white, zine format, 1 sheet of paper. Just print, assemble, and play!
Jam Notes:
While I started this game before the Jam, the "Bad Tabletop RPGs Jam" and this tweet's focus on absurd die face counts reminded me of my unfinished draft of this game, motivating me to finish it.</p></li>

<p>Introduction
Have you ever wondered what it would be like for a to play as group of deities creating a world from nothing?
InOur Pantheon you do just that. Shape the earth, breathe life from dust, meddle in the affairs of mortals. These are a few of the things you can do inOur Pantheon.
This a hack of a free TTRPG from 2005 calledDawn of Worlds. Just like that game, Our Pantheon is completely free! (Though tips are appreciated.)
In this game 2 to 6 players will draw a world map and spend points on powerful actions to create entire civilizations, histories, and worlds. This game takes additional inspiration from games like Microscope and PbtA. If you're looking for something to create a fantasy world to use for a campaign in another system, then Our Pantheon is the game the job.

<p>What would happen if an insane wizard set up shop on a cursed island and decided to blend the dark arts of necromancy and ... nostalgia?
They'd become a Retromancer. And you'd have to hunt them down; probably in some kind of intense, pixelated, twin stick shooter.
Choose Your Champion
Select one of four different characters to match your play style (or master all of them, to prove your skills):
The barbarian is slow but sturdy, hurling massive axes towards their enemies and charging forward recklessly. There's also a lot of yelling. Deadly yelling.
The mage keeps their distance and blasts foes with arcane bolts that steer themselves to the nearest target. Hang back and shred the air with razor sharp magical shards.
The hunter darts in and out of combat, sniping at monsters with fast-firing and long-ranged arrows then darting out of the way.
The cleric's greatest strength is their faith, which happens to let them fill the air with spheres of holy light that explode and tear apart the creatures around them. When their devotion is especially strong, they might even be blessed with free armor.
No matter which you choose, you'll level up as you fight through the Retromancer's forces, gaining damage bonuses and recovering armor as you go.
Arm Yourself Against the Madness
Take advantage of weapons and power ups to deal more damage, fire faster, dodge enemies, and freeze monsters in their tracks.
Unlock permanent upgrades between games that enhance each character's strengths: mages get even more rapid fire, clerics get more blessings from their gods, hunters become even more deadly at range, and barbarians yell louder than ever before!
Defy Death
A unique death's door mechanic gives you a fighting chance to come back from the brink of death.
Even when your armor has been depleted, if you can survive without taking a final hit for a few moments, you'll recover and be able to continue the fight.
Enlist Your Friends
If the Retromancer is too much to tackle alone, you can recruit up to three friends in the local 4-player co-op mode.
When you do have your friends with you, you'll be able to revive each other when you fall in battle, so you'll never be stuck fighting alone.
Survive The Journey
Battle through 30 stages spread across 6 areas on the cursed island of Qor, challenging a vast array of crazed monsters ranging from rats and beetles to sentient trees and extra-dimensional horrors.
Endure a plague of locusts in the haunted woods, overthrow a cultist army in the ruins, surrender your sanity to the creatures of the Void, and kill the Retromancer.

The game spread throughout this issue is New Forms, an eerie atmospheric chamber larp in the Nordic style, heavily inspired by the works of horror/weird fiction/philosophy writer Thomas Ligotti. Players assemble in a strange variation of asupport group, using an apparatus of light and shadow to search for unusual "forms" hidden within mundane objects, recording and discussing their findings and what insights they reveal in relation to the group's ominous otherworldly beliefs. 
 New Forms is playable in two hours or less and is ideal for groups of 3 to 12 players (number of players is the main factor governing the larp's runtime).

<p>Warm then Hot is a game to be played in real life with your friends. It asks for intimacy; maybe a radical type, of openness, of warmth, of being supported by the people who love you and who you love. It's an experience about tenderness, about finding the words for the things that hurt you, and finding a common ground with the people who you share space and community with.
All you need to play is some friends, a fire source that's safe to use, paper and pencils, and some marshmallows -- or any other roastable treat.
As someone who is aromantic, Warm Then Hot is an aspirational game; a game where we can delve into our pain freely with our friends, and eschew traditional relationship roles where we only burden those we are romantically involved in, and for that reason it's also my submission to Fraudulent Gays Jam 2020.</p></li>

<p>Welcome to the world of pixelated chivalry, where your courage, your reflexes and fame will encorage you to reach the dream of every self-respecting knight.
Our protagonist travels to Pixelville to fulfill his greatest dream to prove himself a horsemen winning the championship of "The Big 5", recognized as the unbeatable knights of the realm.
An epic adventure set in medieval ambient and the world of chivalry, where our protagonist must acquire new and increasingly better equipment to achieve his mission.


This game was originally released on 2012. Since Desura is not available anymore we uploaded our first game here. It was meant to be satire of all the tropes that plagued the medieval games but with our lack of humor the game ended up being less critical than intended. Hope you like it! </p></li>

<p>Please note you get a freedigital copy of this game when you buy a boxed edition of Vegetables Deluxe from Double Sided Games (on disk) or Psytronik (on cassette).
Vegetables Deluxe
Controls:
Use a joystick in Port 2. While playing, press P to pause and un-pause the game. Press Q from pause mode to quit to the menu screen.
Playing Instructions
On the menu screen, use joystick left and right to select a game mode. Joystick up and down changes between in-game music and sound effects. Press fire to start the game. 
The object of the game is to make lines of three or more matching vegetables. To do so, you can swap the position of any two vegetables on the play screen by holding down fire and pushing in a direction. When there are no valid moves left then the board is shuffled  until you run out of shuffles, then its game over!
Match three vegetables and they are removed from the board, with new shapes dropping down to replace them. Occasionally an immovable block will be dropped. These can only be removed by strategically dropping them until a line of three or more immovable blocks is made. Match four shapes in a row to destroy a full row or line and match five to destroy all matching shapes and get an extra shuffle.
Game Modes
There are four game modes, offering a gradually increasing level of challenge.
Casual
In casual mode, the emphasis is on a relaxing game, with very few immovable blocks being dropped. It is still possible to run out of moves, so dont get too complacent!
Classic
In classic mode, immovable blocks are periodically dropped, making it gradually harder to make matches.
Shopping
The objective of shopping mode is to make the number of matches indicated on the left hand side of the screen. At first you need to match 3 of each shape to beat the level, with the number of matches you need to achieve increasing each time
Countdown
Countdown mode is the biggest challenge of all. You have a short time to make a match before the timer runs out. If you fail to match before then, you lose a shuffle. In this mode, you do not lose a shuffle when there are no valid matches  only when the countdown timer runs out.

Story

Embark on a journey through your last years of high school and beyond as you try to find success, love, and yourself.
Aya Mizuki is a pretty typical teenager - cynical, lazy, and doesn't know what she wants to do with her life. As she finds she has a passion for volleyball, your choices will help guide her to passion in her love life as well.
Things don't always end on a high note... but sometimes, that's just how life is.
Characters


Aya Mizuki is a quiet, but lazy girl. She's not very social, and tends to spend most of her time with her nose in a book. She spends some of her evenings warming the bench for the school's volleyball team, as having club activities always looks good on a college resume. After a tragic accident injures one of the team's star players, Aya is called upon to step in, and with her Grandpa's help, finds a passion for volleyball that extends past her senior year in high school as she pursues a career.

Nanami Ebihara is the volleyball team captain, and hates the fact that Aya isn't taking things seriously. Quiet, shy and unassuming, Nanami is far from a typical high school sports star, instead she dedicates her life to her craft.

Yuka Saito is one of the most popular girls in school, pretty and with a sharp sense of humour she's the life of the party, so to speak. She flirts with and befriends Aya, introducing her to the local bar scene.

Eri Toyama is one of Nanami's oldest friends, and joins the volleyball team after meeting Aya. She looks up to Aya as a big sister, and though she has a lot of problems in her home life, she's always optimistic, cheery and cute.

Yuichi Hiyama is the star of the school's soccer team and is tipped for great things in the future. Yuichi and Aya become fast friends over their shared love of beef bowls. However as tryout season approaches, Yuichi comes to Aya with an offer she may not be able to pass up...

Aya's grandpa Satoshi lives in the countryside and takes care of Aya in the summer. Satoshi had an oddball sense of humour, an equally oddball laugh and loves his family very much. Maybe it's all the tea he drinks. What Aya doesn't know is that he was once an athlete too.

Story description

Ecchi Sketch: Draw Cute Girls Every Day follows the story of Yume Akiyama, a girl in her mid twenties who works at a real 'dead-end' job - at a funeral company. Her real passion, however, is anything girl x girl - manga, anime, videogames; if it has cute girls romancing other cute girls, then she's a fan.

A talented amateur artist, Yume is suddenly given the opportunity of a lifetime - to be a mangaka at a manga studio! But with so many other attractive girls at the office... will she be able to concentrate?


Characters

Yume Akiyama
Yume Akiyama, the heroine of our story, is a graphic designer at a funeral company. She's also a highly talented manga artist and is a superfan of anything girl x girl, be it manga, anime or video games.

Yume's mother died while she was young, so now she lives with her Dad, a high powered executive at Miyuhara Industries.


Kyoko Miyuhara
Kyoko Miyuhara is heir to the Miyuhara fortune. Her father is the president of Miyuhara Industries, a national company on the Nikkei stock exchange.

After a chance meeting with Yume, Kyoko reveals she runs her own company - Shirayuri Media who create girl x girl manga and doujinshi.


Rin
Rin is the jack of all trades at Shirayuri Media. From shading, to cleaning and colouring, Rin handles the odd jobs. Obsessed with pink, magical girls, and all things cute, Rin often comes across bratty and immature. Underneath, however, she hides a heart of gold.


Megumi
Megumi is a talented storyteller, a hobbyist musician and deep thinker. She often loses herself in her own thoughts... sometimes in the midst of conversation.

She often questions her place in the world, and can come across a little abrasive. Her personal life is a closely guarded secret.

Features
Partial voice acting across 3 major routes.
An original soundtrack.
20+ unique CGs</p></li>

<p>Before we were anything, we were nothing
Before we were together, we were alone
Before we were Rangers, we were Boughless
The world as we know it is aninfiniteforest, so dense that sun rarelypiercesthe canopy. Beasts and monsters lurk in the shadows, ready to eat anything even remotely unprepared. The only place that's safe is inside massive, city sized trees, each housing a unique civilization - The Boughs.
That is, of course, unless you join The Rangers.
If you do, you'll face down Ember-Hounds, teeth dripping with liquid fire, you'll learn the secrets of the Wilds, and how to survive, hell, even thrive among the Shadowless and the Howlers. You'll be called on to stop wars between Boughs, ambush Yix dealers peddling their enchanted drugs, solve mysteries of the endless Firmament deep underground, and explore the outer reaches of the Wastes. You'll see things you wouldn't imagine, you'll tell stories even we won't believe. It's not safe, it's not comfortable and you can't count on fame and riches.
But we will remember you.
The Boughs cry out, we answer
The Boughs is a campaign setting designed for the Dungeon World RPG system, but can function as a system agnostic setting.</p></li>

<p>Void Runner
Teleport Through Obstacles In ThisFast-Paced Infinite Runner
In Void Runner, your objective is to survive for as long as you can by avoiding obstacles. In this infinite runner, you teleport instead of jumping. This means you can teleport through obstacles, but be careful, teleport too soon and you might end up in a wall.
Void Runner was created in collaboration with my brother. We were inspired by other infinite runners but wanted to take a different approach to how you avoid obstacles. We hope you enjoy playing Void Runner as much as we enjoyed making it.</p></li>

Thistime, however, Alex will be doing this on her own.
It's a routine job... so why do things feel a little more dire than usual today?
US LOVELY CORPSES is a short surreal-horror-romance visual novel about helping a friend. Go through the house, cut the roses, and save the girl. Just remember: the monster knows you're here.

It is a tactical memory game, built as a documentary, where you Follow Doctor Li, and relive the early days of the Coronavirus epidemic.
The outbreak from Huanan Seafood Market, The courage of the quarantined population in Wuhan ("Wuhan, Jia You !"),#IamNotAVirus and the surge of ordinary racism throughout the worldThe "Diamond Princess" confinment,and more...

What is coming next :
The story mode is pretty much complete. However, depending on the reception, more might come :
Custom levelsBigger resolutionSmartphone and steam versions




The story behind the game :
The idea of the game emerged on the 2nd of January 2020, 10 days after the beginning of Wuhan quarantine.
We had been witnessing the early days of the epidemic unfolding, such as the quarantine, the prejudices against Chinese-looking associated with the #IamNotAVirus hashtag, the iconic death of Li Wenliang... We realized that there was a story to be told.
But a few weeks later, we also experienced a kind of denial in our countries : "It is just a flu". There was a message to pass!
 The first edition was published on the 11th of March, 5 days before French Confinement. But also 3 weeks too late to be of any use for prevention... However we still thought that the main message of encouragement "Jia you!" was more important than ever.
In the following weeks, we kept improving the game. And the 10th of May, the last day of our confinement, it was important to us to add a new layer of narration through the achievements : retell our own experience of the confinement. With a 7-weeks shift, it creates a surprising symetry with Wuhan's.
As we publish this version, the 10th of June, players might be fed up with the Coronavirus and prefer to move on. But maybe that, in a few month or in a few years, it will be interesting, pleasant, or even salutary to come back  to relive those crazy months.

Will you conserve oil to keep your lantern lit or will you save your sanity and attempt to ward off the horrors of the spire?

<p>An attempt at a starfox ish game developed in 2017. Initially it was released on PS4 and Steam. I removed it from sale because it was badly reviewed and sold terribly and I felt like I should stop charging money for it. I found out later that there was at least 1 person who really liked it so I'm putting it up free here.

<p>

"What is my purpose?" the automaton asked.
"You pass butter," replied its creator, the words falling in a staccato torrentupon the tiny creation's semi-sentient psyche like every hammer upon every anvil.
The weighty words rang out through the space between them in the span of time it took for an eye to blink and a universe of possibilities and hope to shatter to pieces.
You.
Pass.
Butter.
No more, no less. Darkness closes in.This is all there is.
You may find yourself making a character for the 5th edition of a popular dragon and dungeon adjacent roleplaying game, and in doing so, you may ask yourself, "What IS my purpose?" Finally, there's a character background for you: the Butter-Passing Robot. It's mechanically sound and fit for use in a 5e game, though I might suggest it should probably only be used in a campaign with the appropriate (read: silly/ridiculous/hope-crushing) tone. You know, I hear there's even a boxed set and book that this would fit seamlessly into. Hunh.
This project was quick, simple, and meantfor fun, so I hope you get a laugh out of it, but if you do choose to use it in a fairly light-hearted, non-overly-serious game of 5e, all the relevant bits and pieces are there to make it work like any other background.To check out more(far less ridiculous) work from Cody Faulk, check it out on DMs Guild, DTRPG, and P.B.Publishing.</p></li>

<p>Rolling with Laughter isn't an adventure. Well, it is... I mean it not JUST an adventure. let me start over.
Rolling with Laughter is a high fantasy adventure but it is also a guide meant to show you, the GM, what turns an adventure into a comedy adventure. Each scene contains an explanation of its narrative purpose, a list of the comedic devices that are used to set up comedic moments and the expected outcome of the scene so you could easily improvise and build on any development while having an endpoint to aim to.
Rolling with Laughter can be easily run in any gaming system but is delivered with Dozens - A simplified few pages role-playing system specially designed for games that don't want the story to be bogged down by the mechanic.</p></li>

<p>Idris is a bonds man- a special bonds man. While most of his clients need to bail loved ones out of jail, a few are looking for a reprieve from someone they once knew. For Evalise, all she wanted was to get a bail bond for her boyfriend, when Idris surprised her with a simple but confusing question.What if you could make him forget all about you?

Evalise's boyfriend has a bit of a wild side... and a bit of a knack for being caught. She arrives at a bail bonds place run by a man named Idris- however, while working out a bail bond, he springs a question about a different kind of bond- a memory bond. With his knife, he's able to sever any ties a person has with someone else, permanently, making the other person completely forget about his client. With one small cut, she'd be able to leave her not-so-great boyfriend behind and move on...

That Which Binds Us (TWBU) is a josei otome visual novel centered around a young woman named Evalise.

How do you see the world when nothing is real?

Each character was assigned to give a statement to be posted on this store page. Their responses are below:


CHRIS:Hello! Im so excited that youre considering playing our game! I'll tell you as much as I can. So we're actually not the full game. We're the demo! No one knows if the real game is out yet or not, or what genre we're really supposed to be....it's kind of confusing. But that's just fine, I guess! Anyway, I suppose it's already been determined where you'll be going and what kinds of things you might be doing? I hope I get to actually meet you later. I've really been looking forward to it! Have a nice day!




HOPE:hey if u get any choices that lead u to a mochi store go there thats where the cool ppl in the game r if you dont youll probably lose ok bye



ASPEN:Hey YOU! Yeah, YOU! Wanna chat it up with some cute girls? (And a super cute non-binary person?) Then you've definitely found the right game! We're not like those other inferior dating simulators. We have the advantage of knowing who, how, why, and what we truly are! Well, uh...mostly. That's where you come in! You can be the one to tell us once and for all what we're really doing here! And with the help of your good buddy Aspen, we'll ensure that this game gets its best ending! Our fate rests upon your shoulders, O wise player!



NARI:[Declined to give a statement.]



ISADORA:WHAT?!??! MY QUOTE IS GOING TO BE LAST????? THAT'S NO FAIR!!! YOU SHOULD CHANGE IT SO THAT I'M, LIKE, AT LEAST SECOND? OR THIRD?!?!!? LAST IS SO STUPID!!!!!! NARI DIDN'T EVEN SAY ANYTHING AND SHE'S NOT EVEN LAST!!!!! UUUUUGGGGGGGGGGG(...wait so what exactly should I say then? ...oh, ok.)Hi! I'm Isadora, and...uh...(Oh, whatever, this is so stupid!

<p>A collection of games I wrote over the years in Java with their full sources. Some are rather complex games, and I tried to complete them to a playable state (Sea Wars being the most complex), some simpler (Similar, my 2nd applet game from 2006).
SeaWars is a relatively complete 2D strategic game that play on maps: a global strategic map and a zoomed tactical map. On the strategic map you play as you want, with only events that you can avoid without penalties (in this version). But you don't see the enemies, or your civil ships. On the tactical map you fight. You see the enemies only if they are damaged, otherwise you need to detect them. If too far you might not know if they are in your camp or not.It's a simple game on some aspect, but complex on some other. For instance missiles and torpedoes can follow way points then seek for a target.It became a bit too much for one person, so I finally "fixed" the gameplay this year, adding full save, separation of surface units and submarine (by default you will command surface unit, but you can manually decide), addition of civil unit and many small changes and fixes.And it would be the ideal game to mod, complement, or use as a base for other game: use some algorithms or ideas within another game.Draw was SeaWars. I accidentally discovered that the tactical map of Sea Wars could do very cool effects. Draw was born. The engine below if the same, the elements you see are still missiles and torpedoes, and they think they are in a naval game :). It's the most polished "game" here, and was finished around 2009, with only additions since then, and an automatic throttle system: the number of elements allowed changes depending on the FPS. But it's also one with many parts remaining from SeaWars. I kept them "in case". One of the latest addition was to reintegrate a SeaWars mechanism...
Similar is the oldest game. Based on a Palm Pilot game (for whose old enough to remember), it was aimed at being a very light online game. And it is. Using pure Java graphics systems, it is also suffering for that. It is still enjoyable, and had some good success when it was on the web (>10.000 players), but would greatly benefit from a remake. The score are not saved anymore, as I chose to keep the ghost code that was saving in a distant MySQL server ( DBSupport.addScore(playerName.toString(), score, nbColors, sizeGrid); ). Feel free to add a local DB support, or a modern score system. I will add any change to the code!
All my code is released under MIT licence, so you are free to do whatever you want with it. The games are mostly easy to change, up to a point - some parts might not be so simple - so can be modified by children, with a little help. Feel free to share new creations or modifications. If you contact me I will be happy to share them as part of the pack here!
All the games were originally Applets, so POJO without many dependencies. They can be compiled and run within Eclipse or another IDE very easily.
The current pack is ready to run on Windows, but it should be relatively easy to run on Linux. If you can do a distribution for it simply contact me. I will help you do that and give you a free key. A Mac version is on the work but could benefit from some help too!
All good modifications can be shared within the pack with the authors credited! Just be careful if you use API or assets for their respective licences. Be careful that GPL APIs cannot be used as this project is under a MIT licence, which allows commercial use without sharing source. LGPL APIs can be used if used as libs only (not part of the project's sources).

You can also fetch the code from the public repository: archive on BitBucket

Buying this pack will support creating more content such as that!
If you encounter any issue, please contact me. If you are a developer, feel free to look at the code! I will credit anybody that helps! :)

<p>Escape Room Simulator brings your love for the classic genre into glorious 3d*. Escape from elaborate escape rooms or build your very own*.
Affect and alter your rooms by crafting objects and affecting them through the use of properties and plain language commands; build rooms as simple or as complex as you wish, or just experiment.
*Please note the alpha version is limited in what you are able to build and more features will be added over time! This build has a preset level for you to experience and I will be releasing more little rooms to explore over time.

FYI: latest build available includes quality settings toggle buttons / keys, as Escape Room Simulator can be pretty resource heavy. Press 1-6 to change quality from (1) lowest to 6 (ultra) OR press m to toggle mouse on/off and click the buttons in the top left corner to change the quality.

Interactive dialogues about gender, revolution, and resilience.

Warning: these works use glitchy visual effects that are probably not safe for people with photosensitive epilepsy. Please be careful!


"All the time I'm having to make up stories. Because you are a friend, I can confess about it this way, but you know, if you'd interviewed me just like all the other interviews by people who are like, 'what is a transgender?' I would have had to lie."


Explanation
This is a series of works that came out of a residency carried out in early 2018 in Tokyo, with the Creator Ikusei project, which is supported by the Japanese Agency for Cultural Affairs. I adopted research techniques from ethnography and history, such as open-ended interviews and participant observation, and developed a method of representing the results of this research in a playful and interactive form that draws heavily from familiar interaction design patterns such as the tamagotchi-style virtual pet and role-playing game multiple-choice dialogue systems.
Some of the development was funded by Making Ways, Sheffield City of Makers.





All of these pieces are made in Pico-8, a simulation of a 1980s computer that never actually existed..

Installation: Interactive Portrait Cushions
 
In late 2018, an innovative new installation was created with funding from Arts Council England, using textiles by Anne Smithies and custom-made handheld consoles based on the Adafruit PiGRRL Zero. This creates an intimate space and a tactile engagement with the material, encouraging a sense of proximity to the material. The extensive use of textiles also encourages participation by people who might feel turned-off by the signifiers of videogames culture, creating a sense of a traditional domestic material culture colliding with avant-garde digital aesthetics.

<p>"Thanks for trying out the latest dimension in Game Boy games!"
For April Fools Day 2020, I decided to take my GB Studio project, "Rulent Tower", the adventures of a bunch of parody furry characters in an apartment building together, and "convert" it to VR. I only had a few days to smash it together, so the scope had to be restrictive, and a lot of things got left on the table. I wanted to finish adding in some of the ideas I'd had to scrap, as well as new ones I'd come up with. Cut to two-and-a-half weeks later, and now I'm ready to call this final.
This is a 5-10 minute gimmicky prototype. There isn't a ton to do here, as it's more about the novelty of seeing these pixel graphics converted to voxel and presented as if you were actually there in GB Land. There's a few oversized props you can play with, and maybe an easter egg or two, if you poke around. 

There are two versions included. One intended for PC VR hardware, the other built specifically for Oculus Quest (and can run untethered). You'll need to sideload the APK for the Quest, but there's an easy-to-follow tutorial linked in the included Readme if you've never done that before.

Controls: Point your blocky mitts at something that interests you. If it's interactive, the small dark green beams will switch to light green. You can grab objects from anywhere those beams can point at, so don't worry about things being out of reach. You can teleport around by pointing the voxel foxel at the floor location you want to visit.
There's no in-game menu, so on PC if you want to Reset the Scene, hit "R" on your keyboard. If you want to close the game, use your VR overlay's Close Software function, or tap "Esc" on your keyboard. If you can't do either of these things, I'm sorry but I've accidentally trapped you in blocky greenscale virtual reality. I promised myself I'd stop doing this...
And I just want to assure you that, even though there were no bugs last time, there are definitely less no bugs now. Or is that more no bugs?
I want to thank my Patrons and other Awesome Supporters who make this stuff possible, including:
Sofox, SuperKing, Jessica Bumpus, MaskRider, A. Kitty, Matt Schock, Jeffrey Perigo, and braedon benson
If you want to see me keep making weird things like this, follow my Twitter ( https://twitter.com/setsunedev ). If you'd like to get credited in works and see behind-the-scenes content, you might also consider backing my Patreon ( https://patreon.com/setsune ).

<p>Wandering Dreams is an adventure RPG zine about exploring a Soulsborne and Lovecraft inspired world full of strange and unique locations, beings, and things that are waiting for discovery by the player. It is designed for solo play and uses custom rules for combat and encounters. Using a deck of standard playing cards and a 6 sided die (d6) the player sets off on a story telling experience into the world of the dream.
During your adventure you can observe, approach, fight, and run from the denizens of this world by your choice. Explore the world using the card pulls and dice for prompts as well as information on what you are dealing with. A journal is highly recommended to track where you have been, what you have seen, and how your character is doing.

The player explores the world using the zine, a deck of standard cards (jokers removed), their favourite d6 (6-sided die), a journal (or paper), plus a writing instrument (pen, pencil, quill and ink, etc.). The deck is separated into suits to represent different elements in the story that will be drawn as you progress.
 SPADES : Locations (here, there, anywhere)
 HEARTS : Events (happens location to location or in a location)
 DIAMONDS : Things (weapons, attire, tools, antiquities, etc.)
 CLUBS : Beings (bad, neutral, people, beasts, the unknown)
After drawing a card the player will roll their D6 and find the card suit, value, and rolled result in the tables provided inside the zine. The zine provides alternative play styles for players who want to challenge themselves further with story writing and character development.

Character creation has been streamlined to a die roll before starting the adventure. Each character will have predetermined stats, starting equipment, and a small backstory prompt for the player to work with.
A total of 6 character archetypes will be included in the zine to start with templates for additional custom characters as the player sees fit.
Characters can be built in the game and transferred over to other game engines. Wandering Dreams can provide you a template for backstory creation and character development.

Combat is designed to use as few cards as possible and your trusty D6. The player always attacks first and can vanquish many small Beings of the world in one round to keep the story moving forward and remove the need for constant die rolls to get through an encounter.
Alternatively the Player can choose to Escape and avoid the fight all together if looking for more of a exploration style to play or if you encounter a Being that is far beyond your abilities or causes too much fear.
Encounters can be lucrative to find new Things of interest inside the world of Wandering Dreams but can also be deadly and ultimately lead to...

The game ends when the player chooses to awaken from the dream world by death, achieving their end purpose, or choosing to awaken from the dream.
Finding a suitable end point can be difficult and so the zine will include a small list of ideas to get you started with objectives that reflect the world being explored. These can be expanded on with your own ideas and empty templates will be included for listing your concepts.
As you explore the dream more and learn about what is possible the options will continue to expand until perhaps the Beings and Things encountered become too much to handle. The game can be packed away and picked up again at another time as the player chooses.

A large part of zines is the ease of access for everyone. Perhaps you want a new 'uber' table of items to pick from... modify the provided Things tables in the provided blank templates to create something new or just move around what is provided!
Instructions for hacking the zine will be included at the back of it for all designers looking to explore their favourite worlds or original creations using the deck of cards and d6 system. The hacking process is something I believe in greatly for everyone interested in game design and I wouldn't have started this project without doing it myself. Some of my favourites include; Tunnel Goons, Alone Among The Stars, and Take Root.
All purchases of the game for the month of June 2020 will go toward the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund.</p></li>

Set in the late 1950s,The Trolleyinvites players complete tasks in order to dismantle an incline railroad of a recently discontinued trolley line. As the player boards up the gatehouse, disposes of paperwork, and performs other closure duties, they are given a series of inner monolog choices that reflect on urban infrastructure, labor, and technological progress.
The stories, environments, architecture, and scenery are all pulled from extensive research Nicholas OBrien has conducted over the past two years. The often untold narratives of the trolley closures from LA to Atlanta, Cincinnati to Pittsburgh interweave throughout this game. Using conventions from experimental filmmaking, essayistic moving image work, and contemporary story-driven indie games,The Trolleyask players to contemplate the ways in which the absence of the trolley has reshaped American civic space.</p></li>

I love stories and video games. Every day my kids are making up their own characters. It's a shame not to be able to share these creations with more people, but fortunately this has changed.

"Make your adventure" will allow you, even without programing skills, to make your narrative video game in a few minutes. Just Make, Share & Play!

	Take your story, select your characters, write the dialogues, link everything and save it. From that moment you can share with your friends, students or customers 
	a video game that tells your story.

	And 
	It's FREE!

How can that be?
	If you want to 
	share a story with your friends, involve your children's creativity with new technologies, make a newsgame, high impact advertisement, a meme or catch your children/students' attention for learning more while they play, this is your tool. Download the "Maker" and "Player" package from the link below and Make It Real!

	 There is 
	no restriction with the user license if your purpose is non-commercial. If you want an extra income, you have a few restrictions.

	If we reach the online repository stretch goal, 
	you could also share your stories in our web and, if you become a featured creator, you can earn money by sharing them.
How does it work?
	Download the "Maker and Player package" below and follow the 
	video tutorial.
What is the next step
We currently have a prototype that is already functional but with lack of content to play (characters, skins, sounds, music, etc ...)."Create Your Adventure" is focused on content. You can see the characters included in the official package by now, but we need more assets and about more related topics.The more resources we put at your disposal to create, the more we will boost your inspiration, the more stories you will create and the more stories you will be able to play.Next Kickstarter campaign can finance more assets and drive them by your interests. Therefore most rewards are oriented with this goal with affordable cost.</p></li>

<p>A young woman stands alone at the wall, painting deep gashes onto the surface.
The wall isn't attached to anything. Once, a long time ago, it was a construction site. Then a building. Families lived here once. 
Then they didn't, and the other walls fell down, and this remains.
I record the few people who gather here at this lonely wall.
The young woman, who paints her frustration into it.
The young man, who wishes deeply to save people.
The children, who ponder the predestined time.

A visual novel. It was originally planned for NaNoRenO 2017, and was completed over the next two years.

What is Adliberum Engine?

The Adliberum Engine (1.1.61.X) was an ambitious project which was aimedto turn stories into interactive worlds, scenarios and games. A text heavy engine that paid homage to the classic text adventure experience focusing heavily on 'data' whilst offering you full control and freedom.

<p>Accessible parallel gameplay, information gathering puzzle game where you must solve puzzles to prevent threats from bringing harm to Secret Government agency #1's specialized disguise source, Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium.
Vocally Driven Puzzle-Point and Click filled with clever dialogue, ridiculousness, general befuddlement, and lots and lots of moustaches. After catching wind of a sinister plot to destroy Mr. Moustache's Moustache Emporium, a lone savior sets out to defend the city's largest moustache provider! 
By switching between radio channels (by selecting presets or typing in new ones you find), noting the enemy's movements, and piecing together the clues, you can unravel the plans of your foes and stop them! The project is aimed at being color-blind friendly and uses shades instead of color variations to indicate need of interaction. It is also non-hearing friendly as subtitles are provided throughout. We had aimed to include accessibility for the blind but ran out of time. The game is in fact playable by such a person but may require assistance for selecting channels and inputting responses. Future planned features includes keyboard as input for the game focusing on use of the numpad rather than the qwerty section of the keyboard for ease of use and possibly custom hardware for blind user interfaces.</p></li>

In the middle of the summer, a pack of evil bird-thoughts

focused on their own loneliness and internal landscape of troubles.


If you wish, help Karambola on his quest to rescue


his friends from the power of evil thoughts.

<p>The intent of the Human Diaspora was to forge a Star Empire for Earth to rule. In practice, the outer reaches of the galaxy are a shattered fringe of isolationist colonies, each chartered in order to build a singular utopia from the ground up. Each is forged in the ideological image of its founders' dreams, paying lip service  if that  to the regulations of the Interstellar Commonweal.
Two centuries into terraforming the New Republic of Libertaria, the planet is nice enough  well, liveable enough  as long as you live within a few dozen klicks of one of the sky-high toadstool-shaped atmospheric processors. And lucky you, you do, in the urban sprawl around the base of the New Shenzen processor. The daily rains are a side effect of terraforming  should calm down in another few hundred years. The main thing is, your ancestors escaped from the Commonweal's long nightmare of peace and prosperity to found a society based on the real principles of real men  the capital-F Freedom to sell yourself into indentured servitude, own a different military assault weapon for every day of the year, and die from a minor infection because actually seeing a doctor is a deluxe premium optional extra for your medical insurance.
Breathing the air is still free at point of use, but trust me, they're working on it.
An homage to and loose retroclone of Nightfall Games' SLA Industries, Rainworldisa cyberpunk RPG where you play as all-purpose grunts for a government outsourcing contractor. Be a small cog in a big machine  also, the machine is broken, you're hip-deep in sewage, and you're getting the blame if this isn't fixed by lunchtime. And something horrible just grabbed your ankle.
Rainworld is currently under active development  there's currently no art, the text needs editing and polishing, and there's probably a billion typos. This is, nonetheless, a solidly representative chunk of the finished game.</p></li>

<li><a href="https://theinstagrahame.itch.io/the-spirit-of-small-gifts">https://theinstagrahame.itch.io/the-spirit-of-small-gifts</a>
<p>Somewhere in the vast multiverse, there is a post office box. It looks like all post office boxes in all parts of every world, and sits on the corner of any--or possibly every--street. Inside are many levels, inhabited by small spirits whose sole tasks are to ensure that the tiny pieces of every metaphorical puzzle arrive where they are needed before someone needs them. You are one of these spirits. Perhaps someday, you will rise to become a deity.
In The Spirit of Small Gifts, as you talk to your friends about the TTRPG games they're playing, you get to be the answer to the question "Is it reasonable that I'd have _____ in my inventory?" A Spirit of Small Gifts drops small, seemingly valueless trinketsin the mail so that the recipient has them in their pockets when they need them.----Up front, the goals of this game are these: To get people talking to their friends about their RPGs, foster some creative problem solving, and give you an excuse to put some letters in the mail. The goal of this game is explicitly not to override, pressure, or force anyone running a game playing along with your fiction.</p></li>

<p>Youve been hired by Walking Doggos, a subsidiary of Good Boyes, Inc.
Your job? Walking the goodest doggos every day for minimum wage while their owners are at work.
It doesnt matter how many dogs you walk, or how hard you work, you get paid the same no matter what.
So, what does a clever slacker like you do? As little as possible without getting fired.

Walking Doggos
A Game Of Being Barely Adequate
Walking Doggos is a trick-taking game, where the goal is to take fewer tricks than your opponents while still at least winning one trick. There are six suits of cards: Great Danes, Labradors, Shiba Inus, Beagles, Corgis, and Pugs ranked by size of the breed. Each suit has a card numbered 1 through 8 representing the number of that breed that need to be walked.
Players each have a hand of 5 cards held face out, so that only other players can see what cards are being held. Players take turns giving clues to other players as to what cards are in their hand. Once every player has 3 clues, players take turns betting how many tricks they are going to take. After all players have made their bets, players take turns playing a card face up into a pack to be walked. The player who played the highest ranked doggo wins the pack. Players get points based on the number of packs they take compared to what they bet. The winner is the player who did the least amount of work necessary without being fired.</p></li>

<p>[Website] [Twitter] [Discord]

The government has won the cyber war. Their grasp chokes the citizens of every country as oppression rules the world. Then a group of hackers carved out an untraceable piece of cyberspace and created the underground network known as Neon Valley. Since then, it has become a place where both the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free. And such places always attract a need for entertainment, thus the Neon Valley Colosseum was born.
An online shooter inspired by retrowave and neo-80s. Neon Valley takes an arcade-like route to the shooter genre. With high score leaderboards based on both skill and style. Fast-paced combat akin to Quake and Unreal Tournament. Game modes such as floor is lava, obstacle courses and more. Neon Valley is a place where the best come to attain infamy and carve out their name in the cyberspace.

The new frontier Neon Valley. A place free from the grips of the government, a place where humanity indulges. This is where black market trades are done, where secrets are shared and ideas, outlawed by the government, discussed. A world where the good and the bad coexist as the last of the free.

At the core of Neon Valley, the Colosseum exists. On the surface, it thrives as an entertainment complex. As challenges for skill junkies. As a platform to notoriety. But the Colosseum fuels this virtual world. It draws in new challengers all over the world and with this comes opportunity. The black market programmers use it to test virtual weapons. Dealers barter and wager on the outcome of battles. Designers display their latest fashion code. Map editors design intricate battlegrounds. At the center lies you. The user. Will you show the world what youve got?

This is a place of entertainment where most come to conquer the battlegrounds. To prove their skills above all others in the new frontier and obtain infamy. For some of our ambitions never fade through the ages. However, behind the Colosseum and the city is a network of shadows who control its affairs. Some support the rebellion from the shadows... Others profit off the market and guide its very design. Their whims might be in your benefit.


Battle suit
Here users compete with Battle Suits. A program interface which a user takes control of, giving them freedom of movement and an assortment of items. Items which they take onto the field for offensive and defensive purposes. Users battle to unlock new gear, increasing their prowess on the battlegrounds, climbing to reach the top of the leaderboards.

Movement
Your suit has full range of motion using WASD inputs. Each suit has the ability of partial air control, adjusting your trajectory mid-air. This also includes sprinting state activated with Shift. Crouching state with C input, for taking cover behind low objects and a smaller attack profile. Eventually for better shooting accuracy and going under obstacles too. Also, stealth option with the newly added foliage. Its also the state you enter after performing a slide maneuver.

Sliding
Talking about slide maneuver, sliding is patched in. Activating crouch whilst in motion will perform a slide. While sprinting the battle suit does a short dash, followed by an extended slide. Sliding in air, it slightly increases user down velocity, to mimic a shinobi air dash move inspired by ninjas.

Dashing
Expending stamina/energy to dash allows the user to increase directional acceleration of the battle suit using small boosters attached to the lower back. This booster is used to avoid enemy attacks, dashing onto areas just out of reach and general evasion or positioning.

Wall Jump
Increased leg thrust power in the battle suits allow for users to wall jump. Covering further distance and allows for consecutive wall jumps. This is a great utility maneuver to reach higher ground, avoid pursuit and out play opponents.

Shields
Each battle suit has a forcefield as the first layer of defense. Take cover when it breaks to regenerate or risk taking damage to your health.
Stamina
Yes, stamina is simulated in this virtual world. Something to limit the freedom of movement and create opportunities for entertaining situations. Dashing, sliding, sprinting and wall jumps consume stamina. However, it will regenerate given some cool down time.

Character customization
Added a range of items for character customization, more are in the works! They are rewards for gladiators who participate and awe the spectators in combat. Inside the Colosseum
or the arena. Find the orange card, in a club for champions.

Camera controls
Each battle suit is fitted with a small drone camera to provide a wider perspective for better spatial awareness. You can activate toggle this camera with Q. Your visor and drone camera are designed with adaptive magnification built in. Allowing the user to freely zoom with or without weapons fitted with scopes.
Shoulder switch
Use Z to switch shoulders in 3rd person. This will move the default shoulder position of the drone camera to the other shoulder. Useful in peeking around corners, better bullet trajectory for tight angles and also for user preference.
Alt
Hold Alt to look around with the camera. In 3rd person this will rotate the camera around the user. Basically, allowing the user to easily surveil their surroundings or to check themselves out.

Relay cam
When shot, your drone camera deactivates. This switches off the drone camera and reactivates first person view. Pay attention to drone cams peeking around corners, deactivate them and restrict the surveillance utility of your enemies.



Combat
Users have numerous weapons at their disposal, from pistols to rifles, lasers or ricochet bullets. Numerous gadgets are available too, from gravity modifiers to teleportation tools. Abilities that create shields or grapple hooks. Primary, secondary and Akimbo that replaces primary with a secondary. Equip in the menus or in The Mainframe. They are restricted by the Red multi-pass to access. Winning gets support from anonymous arms dealers unlocking more tools at your disposal.

Dual wield
The largest change to guns. Secondary weapons can now be equipped dual wield. Even though it replaces the primary weapon slot, the idea is that a dual wielded weapon has the same power and perhaps more versatility than a primary weapon. Giving users this option is part of the game design philosophy of allowing users to fully customize their gear according to a playstyle they wish.
Melee weapon - Primary weapon sub-class
Added the slide for a reason. To increase the ninja-like game feel, the long awaited Ninjato sword has been added. The first of the melee weapons. Still working out fluidity kinks, motion and better collision detection.
Ninjato has a 4 attack types:

High & low
High attacks, using Left Mouse input, the user dashes towards looking direction and this attack has 3 moves in its combo. Low attacks uses the Right Mouse input and the user performs a slide motion whilst slashing in a 3 move combo too.

High and Low attacks can be interchanged to perform different combos. For example, R + L + R will perform a high, low, high attack chain. Attacks have a movement multiplier according to movement input. Holding forward, attacks lunge further as gap closers to reach gun users. When holding backwards, attacks are performed on the spot.

Jump
The jump attack gives the user a double jump, essentially. At the apex of the double jump the user attacks, reaching targets with the height advantage.

Slide
While in sliding motion there is a small window to attack, which triggers a slide attack. Shortly dashing the user forward whilst simultaneously slicing vertically, the user can quickly reach an enemy and damages everything along the dashing path.

Gadgets
Each gadget has a certain utility and mostly defense oriented. Designed by the River dragon these tools are locked behind the blue multipass. Various shields for defense, or get creative and use them as platforms. A pulse clear which absorbs all incoming bullets akin to bullet hell games. Lastly, a gravity multiplier which grounds any object in its range and stuns enemies. Apply these limited ammo items in the right situation to triumph.
Nades - Gadget sub-class
There are four grenades in the users arsenal. Vision distortion, teleportation, explosive and a force push sticky nade. Each has their own advantages.

Movement gadget - Gadget sub-class
Rapid terrain traversal gadgets, which are perfect for repositioning and moving over obstacles. A booster pack which propels the user where they are aiming, designed to be the most agile of the movement gadgets. The grapple hook moves the user the furthest but at the cost of telegraphing their movements. Lastly, the newly added boost pad. A gadget which can be used offensively as well, setting a trap for enemies and launching them away from you Or into a vulnerable position.



Maps
Many battlegrounds are available and each provides their own environmental challenges. Designed to cater to certain playstyles while testing others. Ranging from close quarters to large monolithic structures perfect for vertical gameplay. Numerous new battleground designs are continually being developed, and with successive firmware updates, they will become available.

Taiyo
A map designed after a Japanese village. Once a trading forum this cyberspace has a village center, tight alleyways and buildings with breakable walls. Surrounded by forests with dense foliage for stealth. Terrain has heightened waterfall for an overview of the village and obscured pathways.

Cube
The designated training map for gladiators. The blocks are orderly placed to practice ricochet shots and wall jumps. It provides a balanced battle map and segmented into optimal areas for each weapon class. Cube has patrol drones that provide training against the corporations offensive systems. They are designed with sturdier defenses for increased challenge.

Monolith
A mysterious monolith has crashed into the center of this map. It has interesting gravitational properties which dynamically change the map when the trigger is activated. This map favors long range combat with the long cracks into the terrain made by the impact.


Modes

Invader
Obviously inspired by invaders, this mode challenges the user with an onslaught of various attack drones. Each armed with unique functions to hinder or deal damage. They spawn above the colosseum in waves, tracking down their target.

Lava
The terrain turns into lava on selected maps. Firewall inspired lava rises, slowly consuming the map and increases difficulty traversing the map in floor is lava mode. With a rising lava tide you must reach the counter hack objective. This will push back the fire wall lava and give you back valuable ground. Hold the points against spawning fireballs, more users in the zone the more points awarded However, more fireballs will spawn. When making contact with lava the user will be shot up, like the classics.
Scoring when reaching a point with the following multipliers: on survival time, wall jump count and time spent not touching the ground. Bonus points on up to 3 other users who also reach the point, motivating cooperation. More users on the point increases hacking speed.

Data
This mode is designed after search and destroy Sort of. Disable the virus before it infects your code, bring it to the quarantine zone to dispose of it. But from the cyberspace breach, where the virus entered from, debris are crashing in and falling across the map. Avoid getting crushed while avoiding opposing players who might be after the prize.
Reach the designated quarantine zone and get points. The quarantine zone, according to a timer to avoid viral countermeasures, reaching one of these zones within 15 seconds of it spawning with a virus will give a large multiplier. Avoid obstacles, falling debris from the breach and other players hunting you down. On death the virus will detach and begin finding a new target.

Multipass system
Completing objectives, and reaching the required points will reward the user with a multipass. According to the favor of the dragons whom benefit from these matches. Keep an eye out for anonymous rewards from hidden backers each with a stake in your success.

Scoring
Scoring is done on objective completions or kills However, there are multipliers designed to reward stylish gameplay. Ricochet kills, gadget combination, consecutive wall jumps, survival count and more.



Enemy NPC
Attack drone: Fastest of the drones, they shoot tiny high speed projectiles. As they are hard to see, stay in motion to avoid damage! When they reach a certain distance from the player they will begin orbiting while shooting. Make sure to not get surrounded.
Roll drone: These drones move about covertly, they roll along the ground hidden amongst foliage and crevices. When in range of their target a tractor beam is activated which keeps its object in place for the attack drones to finish the job. Their beams can be countered if you manage to reach its edge and resist its gravity.
Laser drone: Visually, its most notable feature are its forward shields. Able to deflect most energy weapons. Keep a railgun handy to deal with them or find a more creative solution. Their lazer beams do a high rate of damage per second however their turn speed is limited, presenting a possible weakness.
And those are only the invader drones. There are an assortment of other enemies each with their own behaviors, weaknesses and challenges. From a virus that corrupts what it touches to an electric ball that dodges bullets as it hunts you. Each belonging to specific challenges, however there are more yet. Patrol drones which spawn on the Cube map. Designed as training bots, these patrol drones have extra shielding but an exposed vent port on the back.



Mainframe
The city at the center of Neon Valley. Here one can find a variety of features, however most are locked for gladiators. For security reasons a multi access pass is required. Gladiators can earn these through The Gates. Challenges are designed as minigames, variations on main game modes plus a waypoint race, they are challenges to test the users ability. Training the users for the games ahead. Access will unlock customization options, sampling new technologies from The Dragons and more. Lets just say, everyone has to earn their way in... One way or another.</p></li>

<p>... I've never watched an episode ofPower Rangersin my life. And yet, I'm pretty sure that this is accurate.
Zoom Scouts is an extremely silly story game. You are the Zoom Scouts, radical teens and tweens who have been granted martial arts prowess and giant robots that combine into the Mega Mech. But since soccer practice ran long, this episode of Zoom Scouts skips all the build up and opens with the giant robot.
Work together! Control a robot! Fight a monster! This is 100% goof-em-up role playing, made for playing on a video chat service (although you could do it live together if you're of a mind). Earn tokens by allowing the monster to beat up the Mega Mech; spend tokens to beat up the giant monster, and unleash your ultimate attack when the episode is almost over to save the day. Until next week.

<p>Tampalasan is a rules-light rpg for spear-and-sorcery adventureswith a Filipino/SEA-ian feel. It is a module and hack of Knave's attribute rules, UVG's skill system, and Best Left Buried's grip and combat system. It is also largely inspired by Chris Fabon's Alamat ng Astig and BJ Recio's Meilakanjan.
This is left unfinished as I am taking the game into a different direction (taking inspiration from Macchiato Monsters for equipment and advancement generation) and the rules might change greatly or minimally. So I'd rather release this alpha version for everyone to read. If you feel like playingit, feel free to contact me to clarify any rules or wordings. And I'd highly appreciate any comments, suggestions, or feedback about this version.
This game has an English and Filipino-Tagalog translation.
Any payments for this game will be used to fuel the development of the newer version, which will be a separate project.

<p>This mini -library contains sounds from a reptile shelter. They take in injured, negelcted or abandond reptiles and take care of them. They finance through a small zoo and due to corona had significant loss in income. 50% of the sales of this library will directly be donated to the shelter. For more information check: https://www.reptilien-auffangstation.de/
The recordings contain sounds from 14 different species. With the focus on reptiles, it also features amphibians, mammals and birds.
Ever needed a realistic hiss of an Arabian Cobra, the roar of a Nile crocodile, the sweet chirping of a Djungarian hamster, or the whistling sound of a Reticulated Phyton coming out of cold water? Here you go. With two mic positions in 192kHz I followed around the tails of big (Diamondback-) and small (Massasauga-) Rattlesnakes. I even recorded the purr of giant lizards (monitors). 
If you dont need these specific animals, these growls, sizzling, and calls are a great source sounds for dragons, dinosaurs, monsters and other beasts. Also great to add as a layer in vehicle sound design or as sweeteners to add the noise of a dart frog to your jungle atmo.
These recordings are hard to come by and my mics were nearly hit by poison, that crystalizes and stays venomous for years to come as well as they got nearly eaten by a crocodile (was very scary indeed with me at the other end of the (way too short) boom pole)
The best part, the handling with the animals was very thoughtful. No animals were tortured or stressed. They had some great animal voices at the shelter, that didnt want to speak during the recording session, so we let them sleep and didnt take any animals away from their hide. 
Full List: Arabian Cobra, Diamondback Rattlesnake, Diamond Dove, Djungarian Hamster, Domestic Chicken, Domestic Goat, Nile Crocodile, Massasauga Rattler, Papua Monitor, Puff Adder, Reticulated Phyton, Ring Tailed Lemur, Yellow-Banded Poison Dart Frog and, well, a fish tank with my hydrophone with some weird electronic sounds from the heating.</p></li>

<p>Control the gold paddles using the keyboard. Each time the ball hits a paddle the player receives one point.
Each of the 20 stages has a points goal, and when the goal is met you will proceed to the next stage.
The stages become more complex as you progress, increasing the number of paddles, barriers, and balls. Eventually obstructive gray paddles are introduced which move independently and do not add to your score.</p></li>

<p>You wanna run? You wanna jump? You're gonna fail. Again. And Again. But its fun to fail...right? Take control of HappyMan and hop skip and jump your way past low walls, big balls and spinning red things! A bunch of obstacles await, so get to it.
Run Jump Fail puts you in control of the hapless HappyMan, and tasks you with guiding him through a whole load of treacherous obstacle courses. You'll fail a lot along the way, but watching HappyMan collapse and flail when he's just run into a wall, or tripped on a ledge, or been hit by a big red spinning thing is a lot of fun.Seriously, failing is 90% of the fun. So fail away.The game is a 3D platformer that's dead simple to pick up and play in short bursts, so if you need a break from grinding away at the latest 50 hour epic RPG and fancy a spot of fun filled action, look no further.Obligatory feature list:
Unique physics based 3D platforming action.Ragdolls!50+ obstacle courses, and more on the way.Minigames.Sandbox playgrounds.HappyMan! (he's just the best)

<p>Rosette Diceless is an approach to roleplaying that focuses on collaborative storytelling and consent-based conflict resolution. You can roleplay everything from complex combat to intricate political debate with the same set of simple, quick-playing rules that work equally well for a tabletop game as they do for a LARP.
With Rosette Diceless you can take part in games with many more players than are practical for many roleplaying systems.You caneasily split into groups without dividing the attention of a singlegame master. There's no randomness; challenge resolution issimple and based on resource expenditure, understanding yourtarget's strategies, and setting up story to enable your success.
Rosette Diceless has an agenda: it is dedicated to a consensus-based, story-first, and improvisational approach. We believe that this creates the best social environment for creating and expressing stories that incorporate everyone's creativity.
"this is it. this is the type of thing i'm looking for. something with more ambition than sense, and enough sense to strangle god." - an itch.io user's collection note
Rosette Diceless is a complete, standalone book containing the core principles, character creation and advancement rules, conflict resolution system, and story-running techniques for GM-less games.
For additional guidance and supplemental materials, including new Traits and optional rules, check out the Rosette Diceless website. We're working on a supplemental book compiling these and other materials to enhance your play experience.</p></li>
